1: "Crossed double vajras bar your exit from this very special hell. This is the destination of those who abuse the tantric path, who break their tantric vows through distraction or selfishness. Here the fierce dharma protectors turn upon one in wrath. This is a hell of the most frightful demonic images, the most fearful hell, for its suffering is paranoia rather than physical pain - difficult for anyone else to assuage. Fear for oneself makes it almost impossible to see through the images and escape."
2: "Falling upside down for two thousand years, one reaches the deepest and hottest of the hells. The others seem idyllic by comparison, for the sufferings here follow one another without intermission.\nThe Avici Hell is a prison of incandescent iron. Flames beat against the sides. The gates open and close to frustrate the inhabitants. Some are boiled in iron kettles of molten bronze, \"head down like the ingredients of rice soup.\"\nThis inverted place of torture represents the complete pollution of the world by malicious confusion and perverse, ego centered drive. Such a  state is created by activities that undermine the basis of civilized life: the murder of one's parents, teacher, or holy personage; cutting off the water supply of a nation; and, especially, destruction of the Dharma or the Buddhist community, for this is a blow to the chances of others for spiritual advancement-the worst of crimes, and the very opposite of a bodhisattva's conduct."
3: "In these adjoining torture chambers, one suffers the tortures of intense heat. The ordinary Hot Hell is the karmic creation of those who have committed crimes involving fire, such as incendiary action or killing living creatures in a forest fire. Molten bronze is poured through one's mouth, burning away the intestines. One's anus is pierced through to the crown of the head with thorny, one-spiked weapons.\nThe very Hot Hell is a result of the general activities of the milder hells-killing, stealing, sexual abuse, and lying-associated with the intentional perversion of truth. Quack doctors, for example, are found here. However, this is the special destiny of offenders against spiritual practice: stealing food from yogis, raping nuns or virtuous laywomen, seducing monks, or persuading people to disbelieve in karma with any sort of perverse doctrine. This would include the professional tempting of people into harmful or unprofitable paths. In the main hall of this hell, fierce demons with huge black bellies, flaming eyes, and hooked fangs drag the offender into lakes of fire studded with iron spikes."
4: "The sins of these two hells both involve misuse of the mouth: the improper use of intoxicants and lying. In consequence, demons fill one's mouth with molten copper, which destroys one's insides.\nDrunkenness is not of itself a misdeed, but by becoming so intoxicated with alcohol that one breaks another of the vows - by killing, stealing, or abusing sexuality - one falls laughing, it is said, into the Howling Hell. Especially, the sale of liquor for profit or its use for the harmful manipulation of others gives rise to this bad karma.\nThe Great Howling Hell arises from lying or harsh speech with spiteful intention: perjury, bribery, betrayal of trust, false advertising, and venal government or justice. One who has lied while quarreling with a companion has his tongue grow to great length. Demons then dig in it a deep ditch, which is filled with molten copper; worms are born in its sides, which devour the tongue."
5: "These two hot hells are created by those who violate the second and third guides to lay conduct: stealing and improper sexuality. The offense must have been compounded with murder, for all the hellish states have malice as their cause, whether against life or the killing of spiritual possibilities.\nThe Black Rope Hell is for thieves-those who have taken what is not offered, or appropriated more than their fair share at the expense of others. The victim is caught by demons and bound to the ground with charcoal blackened cords. His body is sliced along the markings with fiery saws and axes until it is shredded to bits.\nThe \"Crushing\" or \"Crowded\" Hell is for malicious sexual offenders. Their torture is to be crushed between iron mountains until they revive; then they are crushed again. In one area of this hell one wanders through forests of trees with sharp leaves. At the top of a tree one spies a beautiful and alluring lover from the past. Climbing the tree, the hot leaves destroy one's body, and on reaching the top the phantom lover is heard calling from the ground. At this point the leaves of the tree reverse themselves to point upward. After a painful descent, the image is once again seen above. Blinded by desire born from ignorance, these victims of delusion never cease pursuing and being torn."
6: "One has fallen into the first of eight hot hells, this one reserved for killers. For the intentional murder of living beings - as through warfare - whether directly or by removing the requisites for life, one suffers here by being tied to others. A string of people murder one another, then are revived by a cool wind to kill and be killed again until their karma is exhausted.\nOne of the neighborhoods of this hell contains hunters who remorselessly have killed birds or deer for food. Here, in the \"place of excrement,\" they are forced to eat a kind of dung filled with worms whose beaks are diamond hard; they are then themselves devoured from inside."
7: "One suffers now in the Cold Hells beneath the earth, parallel to the infernos. As with all hellish states, this is the result of hateful activity - in particular, of crimes against the Dharma from within. There are eight cold hells, their names being sufficient indication of their nature.\n\t arbuda - blistering;\n\t nirarbuda - broken blisters;\n\t atata - chattering teeth;\n\t hahava - where the mouth is frozen and one can only groan;\n\t huhuva - where no articulate sound at all is possible;\n\t utpala - like the blue lotus, where one has a greenish-blue color and one's flesh splits in six petals;\n\t padma - like the red ten-petaled lotus;\n\t mahapadma or pundarika - like the thousand-petaled lotus."
8: "This is hell on earth-isolated places such as a river, mountain, or desert. Whereas the lower hells have been created by the collective karma of all living beings, these are innumerable and individualized, created by individual or group activities."
9: "With great power and cruelty one has become Yama (or his sister Yami), lord and judge of the dead, or one of his police demons (yamaraksasa). His court is the gateway to hell. Ordinary persons must confront him when they die, gazing into his mirror of karma. Yama has the face of a buffalo, and a buffalo is his mount. His right hand holds a club known as \"the punisher,\" the top of which is a skull. His left hand makes a threatening gesture with a noose. He blazes like the fire that consumes the world at the end of the age.\nYama's world is beneath the earth where the sun never shines, beneath blackish red and green clouds; a dark iron castle without doors surrounded by lakes of gore from which fierce spirits, blazing with hatred, are spontaneously produced.\nBeneath Yama himself a monkey-headed demon holds a set of scales on which white and black pebbles, representing one's good and bad deeds, determine one's destiny. After judgment, fierce police demons seize the defendant and lead him upward or downward to his next rebirth.\nThe ugly demons of Yama's retinue, male and female, have come into this state through avarice and jealousy. They may have been wicked kings - or government agents in their previous lives, it is not the case, however, that the torturers of hell, under his command, are living creatures themselves, for if they were living beings, they would also experience the sufferings-the extreme heat, and so forth-of the hells.  Rather, they are a part the karmic delusion of the poor hell-beings.\nYama himself has a subjective aspect, being the personification of the inevitable judgment of an individual's deeds, and a concealed, or inner, aspect in that he is inherent in consciousness that is defiled by desire, hatred, and ignorance. In this square he is called \"karmic Yama\" to show that the external Lord of the Dead is intended."
10: "Just under the earth-and roving upon it-are these creatures, tormented by greed. Their senses are distorted, and the earth seems without sustenance. They have mouths like pins, bellies like mountains, and throats that tum food to fire. Rivers of water take on the appearance of pus or blood. Rushing to a phantasmagoric banquet, they are beaten away by fierce warriors. Fruit trees seem to turn them away with thorny branches. Others among them, who have stolen out of greed or regretted making offerings, are forced to live on vomit or excrement.\nPretas can only be nourished by faith-that is, by offerings made in the course of a religious ceremony and then consigned to them."
11: "Residing mostly in the great oceans, animals are created as a result of previous stupidity-intentional ignorance. Guided by their instinctual reactions, they have, for the most part, no intelligence or will. If domestic, they are bound to servitude; if wild, they are doomed to be killed for the sake of their bodies. Generally, they must suffer to eat whatever comes near their mouths.\nThe serpent is said to be born from anger, the lion from pride, the dog from arrogance, the monkey from greed, the crow from insolence, venomous types from having been animal killers, the carnivore from greed and anger, and the horse from unpaid debts."
12: "One is born a mythological beast endowed with supernatural powers. These animals are \"divine\" because their birth is miraculous, like that of a god, and not from a womb or an egg. Some are pets of the gods-the swans, peacocks, bees, and stags populating the gardens of the heavens. These live in a state of radiance, enjoying the pleasures of the heavens but without any sharp intelligence, and are said to be former sculptors and painters who donated their services to the community. Others are mounts of the gods, such as the nagas and garudas - huge birds with the trunk of a human being and the deadly enemies of the naga-serpents. Gandharvas, \"fragrance eaters,\" are celestial musicians, born for their great love of flowers. Still others are demigods under the command of the gods. The demigods reside in mountains or trees and become the object of local cults, very powerful in comparison to ordinary creatures but often monstrous and malformed-the karmic result of liberality mixed with a violent nature. These yaksas and kumbhandas can bestow good or ill on humanity depending on their disposition."
13: "These water serpents are human from the waist up, rather like mer creatures. They are spirits of the underworld, to be found at points where their realm impinges on ours-such as springs and rivers. They store great treasures of wealth and precious stones, and sometimes books of secret teachings in underwater palaces. Like other wealthy beings, however, they are dangerous and volatile. Benign nagas can be the most generous of allies, but their fierce counterparts are known to cause certain classes of disease. In Tibet they are propitiated as lords of the rain.\nThe powerful nagas were formerly people very generous in temperament, but also angry and cruel. Their deadly enemy is the garuda, strongest of the birds."
14: "These ferocious man-eating demons (raksasas) frequent the night-haunting cemeteries, attacking people, and devouring children.  Their figures are blood-red; they ride a red ass with a white belly called a bong-bu, swift as the wind. With supernormal powers they can take any shape. Demon Island is identified as Sri Lanka, southeast of India. These demons plagued Tibet in ancient times until they were bound by Padmasambhava to the Dharma. Their karmic inheritance derives from the pitiless murder of animals for the benefit of others. From killing they become monstrous and malformed; from giving to others they grow powerful."
15: "One is born among the \"antigods,\" so known for their intense jealousy of the gods of thirty-three who got them drunk and cast them out of heaven. The asuras are proud, envious, angry, and warlike. They envy the gods their riches, especially the fruits of the wish-granting tree whose roots are in their realm but that flowers high up in the deva realms on Mount Meru. Unable to defeat the gods in battle, they attempt to cut down the tree.\nThe asuras live in a \"city of light.\" One asura king named Rahu is responsible for eclipses, periodically swallowing the sun or the moon. They are also associated with storms, earthquakes, comets, meteors, and other astral phenomena."
16: "This is the criminal yogi, who accomplishes the worldly occult powers (siddhi)-pacifying, prospering, subjugating, and destroying - from a desire for power. The state of this demigod Rudra, whose name means \"the howler\" in Sanskrit, results from practicing the tantras without a firm commitment to the welfare of others.\n\"Rudra\" is a name for the god Shiva, and the story of Evil Freedom is the explanation of how this god-as-bully came to exist. There was once a bodhisattva tantrist known as Prince Unassailable. Two men, the first named \"Kau Ensnared,\" whose dharma name became Black Freedom (Moksakala), and his servant Brahmadeva, applied to him for instruction. The servant understood well the import of the secret teachings and kept his vows; but the other took the tantras as an excuse for self-indulgence, broke his vows with all sorts of hideous activities, and expelled the other. When he died, he was hurled into lower states of rebirth for many ages, finally appearing as the fierce non-Buddhist god Rudra His mother died at birth and the townspeople, frightened at his appearance, buried him with her. Feeding on her flesh, he emerged to lead an army of demons in conquest of the world. His former teacher and fellow student, having meanwhile attained great powers within the Dharma, took the forms of a horse (the fierce Hayagriva) and a boar (the diamond sow) and subjugated him.\nA parallel story shows Shiva, \"lord of the world,\" being bound by the fierce bodhisattva Vajrapani to become Mahakala, a Dharma protector.\nRudra is the god of the type of yogi whose accomplishments are based on ego gratification(atma-vada), His \"liberation\" is a form of claustrophobia-imprisonment in the self-made coffin of his ego. He fancies himself the creator and lord of the universe, and is the prototype of the jealous god who must attempt to control everything around him. Hence Shiva's religion is that of power and fear, known in India as linga worship. Stories of his destructive pride are numerous. The god of love, in Indian mythology, has no body because Rudra burned it with a glance from his third eye, in vengeance for disturbing his meditations. An asura king who made offerings to him reluctantly, placing him among the last rank of the gods, had all his temple and offering destroyed by fire and was only able to placate the god by giving up his daughter Parvati.\nRudra is placed here in the last rank of the gods, and just above the less powerful asuras. His only escape from himself is conversion by a tantric bodhisattva."
17: "One has the great fortune to be born in a human condition on earth.  This situation is a mixed bag to be sure, for there are such hells on earth as sickness, warfare, and poverty. Yet it is the luckiest birth among the karmic destinies, for only a human being has these three things: the stimulus to seek an escape from the cycle of death and rebirth, the opportunity to encounter the Dharma, and the leisure to study and practice it. In addition, this is said to be the only continent on which the Buddha will demonstrate the way to nirvana, \"because the inhabitants of Jambu Island have a sharp intelligence.\"\nThis continent, south of Mount Meru, is named after the mythic rose-apple (jambu) tree. Trapezoidal in shape \"like a chariot,\" its center is the diamond seat (vajrasana) at Bodhgaya, on which the Buddha demonstrates the way of Awakening."
18: "Here is the fortunate human existence and great enjoyment of wealth in a land of lakes and pastures. The Dharma is present here but it does not flourish, for the inhabitants are rough and live only by eating meat. Certain traditions record that the people here experience synesthesia - the eye hears sounds, for example, and the ear sees colors - and that they perform the sex act only some ten or twelve times in the course of their lives.\nGodaniya has a red tone in its skies and waters, the reflection of the ruby western walls of Mount Meru."
19: "One has an especially fine and noble human form on the continent east of Mount Meru. Here the light is bright and clear from the crystal wall of the mountain, and the people tranquil and mild."
20: "This continent, shaded green by the emerald north face of Mount Meru, is the happiest of the four human islands. The people lead a whole ­ some communal existence. There is no private property or marriage, and they are undisturbed by desires or aggressiveness. According to ancient tradition, the women nurse through their fingers, and the children are brought up in common-boys by the men, girls by the women.\nLittle work is required for subsistence: Corn ripens of its own accord, and fragrant rice is found boiling on the stoves; the trees are always in foliage and fruit. Because they are not in the habit of declaring \"This is mine,\" and so forth, these people are incapable of the worst crimes and suffer no untimely death, living out their full life spans of a thousand years. Upon dying they do not enter the three lowest destinies.\nNonetheless, this idyllic sort of existence is said to be not conducive to the paths to liberation. Like the gods, the people of Kuru cannot keep religious vows. No saint develops here, for they never come to understand the initial postulate of the Dharma: Life is basically suffering. Their faculties are dulled by their uneventful lives, and they are incapable of difficult meditations. In short, they create no bad karma, but neither do they make progress toward liberation from samsara."
21: "One is born a human being, but in an uncivilized and materialistic society in which warfare is considered the legitimate mode of human interaction. The mountains are pictured as rocky and reddened with blood. This is the karmic result of cruelty, fighting, and pitiless meat-eating.\nIn particular, barbarism refers to the Muslim Turkish tribes who swept into India from Central Asia and, being iconoclasts by ideology, destroyed the images, books, and communities of the holy Dharma. In Lhasa they formed the profession of butchers. In general, this state indicates barbarity -	any philosophy that rationalizes intolerance and warfare.\nIt is acknowledged that in India there occurred an amalgamation of Hindu and Muslim faiths; hence one can rise from here to the top of the Hindu path."
22: "With moderately good fortune one is born into the Brahmanical culture of India, pictured as a green and fruitful land. Here civilization is rich and vigorous, the arts and sciences flourish, and metaphysical speculation is highly advanced. Life here is so full that one tends to adopt an extreme, externalist view. There exists an abiding principle to man and the world. Although conceptions such as \"God\" and \"the soul\" provide a superficial consistency to the world, inspire an exalted ethical code, and stimulate meditative accomplishments, they are ultimately unverifiable and unable to bear scrutiny by logic, and furthermore become a source of bondage to samsara, inspiring misguided and harmful practices such as religious sacrifice and ascetic self-mutilation.\nNonetheless, this rich culture is the birthplace of the true Dharma and the holy land of Buddhism."
23: "Bon (pronounced \"pem\") is shamanism or sorcery in a highly developed form. In Tibet it represents the alternative to Buddhism. Bon antedates the Dharma, having come from the direction of Persia in the early centuries A.D. There are close analogies with other shamanic traditions, such as Taoism. The ancient kings of Tibet were considered sky gods (btsan-po). They were sorcerers, able to travel at will by a heavenly rope or riding a drum among the three realms: the underworld, earth, and sky. The sorcerer is expert in communicating with spirits; his trades are weather making, divination, and funeral ritual, for he can guide the spirit after death.\nModern Bon, on the other hand, has adopted Buddhist scriptures to its own system, and is virtually a replica of the Old School of Tibetan Buddhism. But the bon-po reverse the Buddhist auspicious emblem, the swastika, and circumambulate sacred places counterclockwise, which causes their fellow Tibetans no end of merriment. In comparison with the other non-Buddhist traditions in this game, Bon is considered to have the greatest potential for spiritual progress."
24: "We are at the start of the game, in the present human existence, confronted with six roads of different colors. The fall of the die takes us to one of the six karmic destinies: white for the gods, blue for humans, green for animals, yellow for ghosts, black smoke for the hells, and red for the jealous asuras. But karma is not fate; it means activity, Deeds of body, speech, and mind will determine our destination."
25: "One sets forth toward enlightenment in the vehicle of mantra, the diamond path, the secret way of the practice of spells (vidya). This is the way of the elite and the shortcut up the mountain to Buddhahood.\nIf one came here as a demon, one has been bound to the Dharma by the compassionate force of a tantric master; if one came as a human being, the key is a qualified guru or lama, for among the Buddhist paths this is the dangerous way and the most strenuous and disciplined technique.\nThe mark of a qualified lama is that he or she at the very least keeps his or her own vows, Without the proper commitments this road leads to madness and hell. In addition to the three vows of the Mahayana-refuge in the Three Jewels (Buddha, Dharma, and community), that of the bodhisattva (to save all beings), and that of lay or monastic conduct - tantric practice requires a set of fourteen \"root\" and eight \"branch\" precepts that guide not only physical action but thought and speech as well.\nIn the beginning stages one practices the bodhisattva path in an intensive form, combining the thought of enlightenment (the bodhisattva vow) with devotional commitment and meditative purification. In particular one practices the four common (mahayanist) and the four special (tantric) preliminaries. The former set consists of a week's meditation on each of four thoughts, which turn the mind toward Awakening: the value of human birth, death and impermanence, the cause-and-effect pattern of karma, and the horrors of samsara. These being well learned, there follow the special tantric preliminaries: one hundred thousand repetitions of each of four ritual meditations designed to establish a firm foundation for further practice. These are the vows of refuge and the bodhisattva resolution. the purification mantra of Vajra sattva, the mandala offering to the sources of refuge, and visualized union with one's lineage of gurus.\nIn this way one accomplishes the equivalent of the Mahayana Path of Accumulation in the space of a few months or years. As is usual in Buddhism, knowledge comes only in conjunction with meditative experience and ability."
26: "The great monarch of mankind unites the entire world under a righteous government. The wheel of authority, perhaps to be identified with the roving chariots of the conquerors of old, appears like the sun in the eastern sky of his youth.\nThere are four types of wheel-gold, silver, copper, and iron-which rule, respectively, over four, three, two, and one continents. Petty kings beg to submit to the golden-wheeled ruler, the lord of the silver wheel goes to them; the copper king prepares for war, the iron brandishes arms. In any case, the Cakravartin never slays. Through the previous accumulation of merit-generosity, the appreciation of others, and especially the complete absence of anger-he enters the womb, like the Buddha-to-be, in complete awareness of the situation, and emerges physically resplendent. He cannot be killed by himself or by others, nor can his mother be slain while pregnant with him.\nSeven precious articles benefit the rule of the Cakravartin: the faultless and wonderful queen, the magic protective jewel, the conquering wheel, the great elephant, the swift horse, the righteous general, and the wise minister. Seven minor possessions are also the best of their kind: sword, hide tent, bed, garden, palaces, robes, and boots. The Cakravartin has great physical strength as well as the \"divine eye\": the vision of past and future lives.\nThe dynasty of wheel-turning kings appears just after the golden age of the world (which is harmonious anarchy, with no need of government). As the Buddhist ideal of the state, it presents some analogies with that of Plato's Republic. The ruler, whose status is the consequence of good conduct as a human, protects his citizenry and establishes them on the wholesome paths of activity. The closest to a Cakravartin among rulers of history was Asoka of the Maurya Dynasty (third century B.C.), who governed India in accordance with the Dharma."
27: "One is born into the broadly based lower classes of divinity who rule the lower slopes of Mount Meru, the seven chains of mountains around it, and the skies. These deities regulate the mundane affairs of the world system. The four kings each take one direction, looking out from the sides of Mount Meru over the realms beneath, and protecting the Gods of the Thirty-three, above them, from attacks by the asuras.\nThe four kings are regents for the higher gods over the world; the armies and messengers of the kings are the spirits of water, trees, mountains, and so forth. Some among these gods are associated with the planetary bodies, in the astrological sense of regulators of the world. The kings appear outside the doorways of temples, being transformed from world protectors (loka-pala) into defenders of the faith (dharma-pala).\nDhrtarastra, lord of gandharvas (the celestial musicians), rules the East; Virupaksa, lord of the monstrous kumbhandas, rules the South; Virupaksa, lord of nagas, rules the West; and Vaisravana, lord of yaksa demigods, rules the North. The last is widely worshiped as Kuvera, lord of wealth; he carries in his arms the jewel-spitting mongoose.\nThe apsaras, goddesses of this realm, give birth in a miraculous manner, free of the burdens of menstruation, pregnancy, confinement, and nursing. The child is born (appearing on its mother's knees or hip) at five years of age, and the gods or goddesses think, \"This is our son,\" or \"This is our daughter.\" The child in turn conceives the thought, \"These are our fathers,\" or \"These are our mothers.\" Thus, they grow up with collective parenthood, freed from association with sexuality. During copulation the deities of this level unite their bodies but without emission of substance or loss of energy. As is the case with all the deva gods, sexuality is casual and easily repeated.\nThe Status of these beings is the result of neither aspiring to selfish happiness and goods nor exulting in their possession."
28: "One dwells in a region, at the summit of Mount Meru, with thirty-three divine neighborhoods. The devas of this level are large and powerful, with supernatural sensory faculties. Chief among them is Indra, the old warrior god of vedic times, now a dharma protector who owes his high karmic status to reverence and generosity toward the Buddha, These gods, like their Greek counterparts on Olympus, are not quite beyond the affairs of the world, Their realm was won from the asuras and must be periodically defended. Hence it is surrounded by a wall of gold.\nThe ground of this heaven is rainbow-colored, soft, and yielding to the foot. At the four corners of the mountain are peaks guarded by vajrapiilyi, \"thunderbolt handed\" yaksas. The central peak is Indra's city Sudarsana, meaning \"belleview.\" Four parks with magic lakes grace its sides, each with playgrounds beside it containing soft and lovely soil.\nTo the northeast within Sudarsana is the tall magnolia known as Parijataka, \"full-grown,\" whose incense spreads to all quarters, even against the wind; its shade is the perfect spot for the pleasures of music and love. The divinities of this realm couple by merely touching together their sexual organs. Southwest is Sudharma, \"good Dharma,\" the divine meeting hall for affairs of state. In the center is Indra's jeweled palace Vaijayanta, \"the Conqueror's.\"\nAlthough these gods take their refuge in the Buddha, their pleasure is too great to allow for religious practice. In consequence, they are unable to prevent rebirth in a lower state when good karma is exhausted. There is said to be no greater suffering than that of a dying god who can foresee his or her future rebirth. The approach of a divine fall has five signs: one's dress becomes soiled, flower garlands fade, perspiration clouds the armpits, the body emits an unpleasant smell, and one's seat becomes uncomfortable. With this, one's companions and lovers desert one in disgust. Indra is said to have a gallery of portraits of past kings of this region, depicting their fall and rebirth. The misery that signals the end of this happy state is taken to provide final proof of the necessity of ending suffering entirely by overcoming the very process of death and rebirth."
29: "Even larger and more powerful than the Gods of the Thirty-three, the Yama devas are completely beyond the strife of the world and secure in their possession of heaven. Their paradise hangs in space like a cloud bank, twice as high above sea level as the peak of Mount Meru. The seeds of their past moral conduct, the essence of which is self-control and avoidance of conflict, blossom into the delights of the Realm of Desire: gardens of lakes, swans, water lilies, and sexual enjoyment that is consummated by a mere embrace. Pictured is the wish-granting jewel, symbolizing their pos­ session of whatever one might desire.\nAmong the bodhisattvas in residence here is the king of swans, Suyama, who lives in the heart of a huge lotus. His role is to warn the gods against distraction, so that they may not fall into a lower state at death. At one point Mara, lord of the Realm of Desire, sent down three messengers - Delight, Distraction, and Confusion-to protest this threat to his prerogatives. There ensued an extended discussion of the Dharma, and they returned defeated, unable to shake the devas of this realm."
30: "Although only the fourth of six heavens in the realm of sense desire, this is the most promising for one's future, for it is traditionally the penultimate abode of the bodhisattva, the station before his final birth in human form. The future Buddha Maitreya, \"loving one,\" is presently in residence in Tusita, under the pseudonym \"savior god\" (natha-deva).\nTusita is the most beautiful of all the deva realms. A newborn Tibetan child has reported that the inhabitants drink nectar (amrta), that the flowers are white and grand, and that the buildings, even the earth, are strewn with jewels. This mansion, floating high above Mount Meru like a cloud, is the favorite resort of Buddhist scholars.\nThe noble Asailga, for example, founder of the Yogacara or mind-only school, journeyed here for Maitreya's inspiration.\nFor the ordinary devas of this realm, still bound to sense desires, sexuality is a matter of holding hands."
31: "In this divine mansion, floating high above the summit of Mount Meru, the gods have no need of desirable objects to be present before them, for their very wish becomes reality. So, in the process of increasing abstraction represented by the levels of godhead, they are sufficiently detached from the bonds of the material world as to be able to enjoy the emanations of their own minds.\nSimilarly, they enjoy the delights of sexuality by merely laughing together, by conversation, or by inhaling each other’s' fragrance.\nThe beings of this heaven emit a brilliant golden light. Their environment is filled with jewels, luxuriant gardens of perfumes and flowers, beautiful plants and creepers, and magnificent trees. From their palaces come the sounds of dancing and music.\nThe karma giving rise to this state is a sublime moral refinement and intense generosity."
32: "In these ethereal mansions, four levels above the summit of Mount Meru, dwell the supreme deities of the world of sense desires.\nThe great prerogative of these gods is that they need no previously existent sense objects to enjoy-nor even, like the gods immediately below them, need they emanate such objects from their own intellect. These great beings rule the emanations of others. Their mental powers are such that whatever they may wish for is anticipated by the other classes of gods, who magically emanate it for their pleasure. The example is given of a cook who will prepare his master's favorite foods.\nIn this heaven, sexual desire arises and is satisfied by a glance.\nThe king of this realm is Mara. As lord of the Realm of Desire, this powerful creature is extremely jealous of those who might try to escape it. He sends his armies of pleasant and fearsome distractions to hinder saints and yogis. The successful meditator, passing through his distractions, attains the Realm of Form."
33: "Here, at the beginning of substantial tantric practice, one engages in the tantra of activity (kriya-tantra). Although the highest attainment (siddhi) gained from any tantric meditation is the understanding of the emptiness of all phenomena, the tantras are classified and graded in terms of outer versus inner practice. The activity tantra is especially concerned with the purification of elements of the inner world and the outer world. In it one's self and outer appearances are transformed by the identification of one's ego with the nature of the deity being visualized, one's speech with its mantra, and one's surroundings with its pure land. Thus, self and appearances are transmuted in meditation into the loveliness and purity of the Awakened state. If reality is the play of appearances, molded by karma but arising from emptiness, the aim of tantra is its intentional reformation.\nAccording to the Old School, in the activity tantra the deity, a Buddha or bodhisattva, is only visualized in front of one, in the manner of \"master and servant.\" One then takes siddhi from it. The attainments on this level - before one has made the deity one's self - are generally more ordinary than the supreme attainment, Buddhahood. The danger is that one may practice magic without compassion. The rites of subjugation and so forth are based on the mental reformation of reality. By learning them without a proper commitment to the path of helping others, one's selfishness will only be reinforced. Hence this path may lead to the most harrowing of hellish states.\nNonetheless, if done under proper initiation and guidance, the activity tantra, with its emphasis on outer ritual, offerings, and chanting, will accomplish the accumulation of merit. One ideally will make the best sort of offering: one's own concentrated reverence and powers of attention."
34: "You have become the \"great black one,\" with aggressive and wrathful energies turned to protect the Dharma. Mahakala is a world-transcending protector, not bound to the role by force but committed to it by understanding; his third eye indicates that he is a lord of wisdom. He is chief of the ferocious executioners, trampling down any hindrance to meditation or enemy of the Dharma. In the sacred dances he supervises the \"liberation\" of demons. The powers of Mahakala may be ritually invoked by the initiate to slay an enemy.\nMahakala is acknowledged in different forms by each sect (he has some seventy-five forms in Tibet). He is invoked constantly for protection in the secret \"lord's house\" behind the monastery's altar. Surrounded by flames, he wears an elephant skin on his back and a garland of freshly severed heads. He may be Yama, lord of death, in a new role, or his skull­cup and trident may be considered to make him the great yogi Rudra-Shiva converted to the true Dharma, his ferocious and passionate powers working now to purify the karma of aggression."
35: "Soaring high over Mount Meru beyond the Realm of Sense Desire, these stations of exalted consciousness are the product of \"immovable\" (aninja) karma, neither good nor bad. In fact, the seventeen levels of this realm correspond to the subtleties of progress in meditation. With the removal of attachment to the realm of sensory objects and the successful practice of calming meditation (samatha) comes the possession of an ethereal translucent body, to which neither physical nor mental suffering can adhere.\nThe first three stages, worlds of the Brahma gods, correspond to the first stage of meditative trance, in which the mind is concentrated on a single thought. These gods in particular have the notion that Brahma is the great God, the Creator of all.\nThe second trance causes rebirth among three levels of gods of light (abha). Here the physical pleasure of meditation fades, giving way to happiness and equanimity. From the third trance comes rebirth as a god of splendor (subha), again of three levels (weak, middling, and strong degrees of immersion in this trance); these gods experience pleasure and equanimity.\nAmong the gods of the fourth trance, characterized by equanimity alone, three are included in this square, named \"the unclouded,\" \"merit-born,\" and \"great fruition.\" At the top of this last group is a class of beings totally \"thoughtless\" (asamjni-sattva).\nThey themselves mistake their state for nirvana, but it is merely a state of trance and without true knowledge of the world; when a thought at last arises due to their previous karma, they fall back to the Realm of Sense Desire."
36: "Passing beyond sense desires and then beyond matter, one's mental horizons become so broadened as to encompass endless vistas of space, finally transcending consciousness itself.\nThere are four meditative \"equalizations\" (samapatti) that effect rebirth in the formless or spiritual realm. The four are ranked in order, but, of course, being nonmaterial, they have no \"place.\" Rebirth in them is affected by karma that has no connection with \"good\" or \"bad\"-it is a purely mental state without attachment to material elements. The location of these realms is the same as the meditator's last position on earth-at the foot of a tree, for example, in a meditation hall, or in the realm of the gods of form.\nThe names of the first three levels are based on yogic practices (prayoga).\nl. In contemplating the object of meditation, the yogi transcends all notions of materiality. Hindering concepts set like the sun, and paying no need to notions of multiplicity (ceasing to distinguish the object from its surroundings), he abides thinking 'space is infinite,' so attaining the station of infinite space.\n2. Transcending completely the stage of infinite space, he considers that 'consciousness is infinite,' and attains and abides in the station of infinite consciousness.\n3. Thoroughly transcending the station of infinite consciousness, he abides attaining the station of nothing at-all, thinking 'there is nothing at all.'\"\nThe fourth stage involves no concept. \"Transcending 'nothing-at-all,' he attains the station of neither-ideas-nor-the-lack-of-ideas.\" This is called the Peak of Existence. It takes its name from the debility of ideation (samjna) and not its complete elimination. From this point, however, one can accomplish nonideation, and then the equalization called cessation, in which the stream of mental events is halted for a period of time. This last stage is sometimes confused with nirvana. In these realms, however, attachment to the objects of sense has been eliminated, but there remains attachment to existence. After a period of time, past karma becomes operative and one is reborn in a lower destiny."
37: "Here the heights of the Realm of Form are attained by means of the strongest and most concentrated practice of the fourth stage of trance. Five levels of gods abide here, in mansions floating high above Mount Meru. They are classed according to their emphasis on each of the five cardinal virtues: faith, vigor, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. The last, called the \"unsurpassed\" (akanistha) pure abode, emphasizes wisdom or insight meditation (vipasyana). Partaking thus of the nature of enlightenment, this last Akanistha Realm is not classed here, but at the top of the board.\nThe gods of the Pure Abodes are \"virtuous, mighty, long-lived, beautiful, and enjoying great well-being. They are self-luminous, travel through the air, have pleasant food, live happily, and go wheresoever they wish. They are free from passion.\" Since faith and other virtues besides meditation are involved here, no \"ordinary persons\" (prthagjana) attain to this station, but only aryas, those committed to the Dharma."
38: "Nurturing a disgust for the cycle of death and rebirth, one enters the Vehicle of the Disciples, beginning to plant wholesome roots conducive to liberation. One takes on the role of a monastic or lay disciple, thus joining the noble family of the Buddhist community. By meditations on the repulsiveness of the body (for the temperament dominated by passion), on dependent origination (to counteract ignorance), on friendliness (antidote to ill will), on breathing (against discursive thought), or on contemplation of the Buddha (counteracting all four), one begins to attack the four  perverted views that are deeply ingrained in all ordinary people. These are: seeking permanence in the impermanent, ease in the suffering, the self in what is selfless, and the lovely in what is repulsive. Hence one may attain great meditative advancement. The aim, however, is to gain a degree of mental concentration and to lessen the grossest defilements-attachment, aversion, and bewilderment - that bar the way to freedom.\nOne accumulates merit through worship and good works, and equips oneself for real practice on the path."
39: "Having accumulated merit and equipped oneself with a degree of meditative ability, one plants wholesome roots conducive to penetration-that is, one applies the benefits from past practice toward the understanding of Dharma. One exercises a higher mindfulness, which takes as its object the Four Noble Truths. In this way, based on the \"calm\" of meditation, one begins to develop \"insight\" into the conditioned and impermanent nature of the self. One gains the supreme mental elements of the world, such as the five types of high awareness (abhijna): (1) wonderworking powers, (2) the heavenly ear, (3) knowledge of others' thoughts, (4) recollection of one's past lives, and (5) insight into the past lives of others. The sixth high awareness-the knowledge that one's outflows are extinct-will come at the end of the road.\nIf this path is well accomplished, one rises to the world-transcending paths."
40: "In the course of moral purification and mental concentration, the four noble truths as taught by the Buddha come into view in all their ramifications, One sees that (1) the cycle of rebirth is suffering, (2) the cause of suffering is craving, (3) the elimination of suffering comes from the cessation of attachment, and (4) there is a path to cessation. One abandons the passions that result from doubt, and the view that one's body and mind are possessed and ruled by a central \"self.\" Finally, one abandons attachment to moral codes and ritual. These constitute the Path of Vision.\nOn the Path of Cultivation, the final defilements, which can only be destroyed by hard meditation, are eliminated. The Path of Vision has destroyed the notion of a self; this path destroys the attachment to pleasurable sensation, which persists even after the self is gone, With correct understanding and full concentration, one is able to follow perfectly the Noble Eightfold Path: correctness of views, intentions, speech, conduct, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration. These being firmly established, one experiences the \"diamondlike concentration\" (vajropama­samadhi)."
41: "This second class of the tantras is known as \"the practice of both\" (ubhaya-carya-tantra), for it combines outer and inner yoga. Again, the deity is generated in front of one, but this time \"like a brother or a friend.\" This yoga centers on the chanting of mantras; it is classified as yoga-with­ image (union with the visualized deity) and yoga-without-image (union with the deity governed by emptiness). In the former type, while the mantra is repeated, the yogi rests his or her mind in the heart of the deity. Mindfulness of breath (considered \"the steed of thought\") is practiced to stabilize the meditative image and eliminate discursive thought; thus, calm is developed. In the yoga-without-image, one focuses on emptiness; thus insight grows.\nOther meditative rituals in this class of tantra procure occult powers through the magical manipulation of objects such as a sword, just as in the Pali tradition magical powers are attained by meditating on the great elements-earth, air, fire, and water-until their essential nature has been grasped.\nThe carya class of tantras is seldom practiced in Tibet; yogis tend to move from the activity tantra to the supreme tantra stage. The chief text of this class is the Maha-vairocana, which is the basis of tantric practice in China and Japan."
42: "The yoga tantra is wholly internalized practice. The yogi creates mandalas and complex visualizations involving the Buddhas of the five tantric families. Generating the deity before one in all its detail, one's own nature is made resplendent by its radiance. Into this receptacle descends the real deity, called the \"knowledge being\" (jnana-sattva). During the meditation one's own being becomes identical with the deity, which has been sealed with five seals. So \"having purified all the conventionally true elements of existence and appearance into the state of mentality in the absolute truth (the truth of emptiness), one then generates the divine mandala with the five high Buddhas and seeks the attainment of causing the knowledge being to enter as summoned into oneself as the symbolic being (samaya sattva).\"\nFour of the seals-the great seal, symbolic seal, dharma seal, and action seal-are applied with the appropriate visualization and hand gesture. \"The fifth\"-the knowledge seal-is being itself. They purify the body, mind, speech, and conduct, respectively, of the yogi. The term \"seal\" (mudra) comes from the Sanskrit root meaning \"joy\"; it joyfully \"seals\" one's attainments (siddhi). So, one is now without possibility of falling back into a lower path or unhappy destiny. Being completely identified with the body, speech, mind, and activities of the Buddhas, there can be no misuse of magical powers or slacking of spiritual progress on the bodhisattva path."
43: "One enters the vehicle of the solitary Buddha. This being attains enlightenment at a time when no Buddha abides in the world to teach the Dharma. He is described as having done attendance on previous Buddhas, but failed to attain liberation under their instruction. Being somewhat dull, not even the sufferings of a human existence nor the threat of death brought him to the point of Awakening. As a consequence of his practice, he was then born as a god with no further stimulus to practice. But stead­ fast in his revulsion from samsara, and without hearing again the Dharma of the Buddhas, he continues accumulating merit by good conduct and solitary meditation, until at last the great Awakening is reached."
44: "For long ages one resides deep in the forest practicing meditation.  One especially pursues the four applications of mindfulness: of the body, of feelings, of thoughts, and of dharmas, In this last meditation one considers the characteristics of all phenomena: They are impermanent, not pleasant, empty, and impersonal.\nThe Independent Buddha is likened to the unicorn, who shuns the herd to wander alone in the forest. He is a legendary figure in the ancient Indian tradition of the solitary yogi, a concept that the Buddhists never fully shared, for the Buddhist lives in a monastic or lay community and is much concerned with social relations. The Independent Buddha is cited as proof that the Dharma, the truth about reality, is timeless, for he has discovered and understood it while the Buddha was not about to preach in the world, and when there were no communities practicing the way."
45: "Dwelling alone and far from the bustle of the world, the independent yogi turns his concentrated attention on the meaning of birth and death. He sees that sowing a thought, one reaps an action; sowing an action, one reaps a habit; sowing a habit, one reaps a destiny. In this way he discovers the laws of dependent origination. He sees that death arises in dependency on birth, birth on becoming or conception, this on grasping or copulation, this on sensation, this on sensory contact, this on the senses, the senses on the psychophysical organism, this on consciousness, consciousness on karmic conditions, and these, lastly, on ignorance. So, he sees that if bewilderment is removed, karma will not be created nor consciousness arise, and so birth and death will be removed. He then is enabled to prevent the arising of defilements, for he has overcome the delusion that life is dependent on a single continuing self. With this purification of outlook, he begins the practice of the noble eightfold path toward complete Awakening."
46: "By assiduous meditation on his vision of reality, the pratyeka-buddha destroys all attachment that can arise from grasping, rejecting, or bewildered relationship with the world. At his refined level of existence, all that remains is the attachment to being itself. Without a guide, by his own exertions, he comes to the verge of freedom from rebirth.\nBecause he is a self-made yogi, the powers of the Independent Buddha far exceed those of the disciple, who is timidly dependent on the instructions of others. The Independent Buddha is able to perform miracles, to divide his body and appear double, or to transform it into any shape; though in the habit of avoiding attachment to the external world in general and social entanglements in particular, if need be he will use his high awareness for the benefit of others, and give simple instructions as to the proper lifestyle of a yogi."
47: "The solitary yogi attains an Awakened state. This is the \"fifth path,\" called \"no more study.\" He attains the nirvana in which a substrate of existence remains until the time of death. In terms of knowledge and miraculous abilities, the Independent Buddha has come further than the disciple. Yet, in the Tibetan view, he may still fall back to a lower state, for full Buddhahood and omniscience have not yet been won.\nBecause of this arhat's solitary habits, he has neither the courage nor the ability to teach others the way to nirvana, and he cannot remember the form of the teachings he encountered so long before. In short, he is not a bodhisattva. His attainment is nonetheless substantial, and he is considered worthy of worship by the world, having transcended it."
48: "The Arhat has previously attained nirvana during his life, called the \"nirvana with residue,\" for although all the defiling elements were eliminated, the physical and mental substrate remained. Now, at the time of death, he enters the \"nirvana without residue.\" The nirvana with residue is likened to the elimination of all the outlaws in a saloon; the nirvana with­ out residue would be the complete annihilation of the saloon.\nThree concentrations are the gateways to nirvana. One understands that it is empty, for it has no relation to a \"self\"; it is signless, for it has no definition or determining characteristics; it is wishless, for it cannot be successfully desired. Nirvana as an entity is unlike most others (although it is likened to space), for it is independent and not impermanent it is deathless, peaceful, and \"fearless\" or secure. It is the negation of the world, emancipation, the supreme reality and goal. \"Like a fire, when the fuel is burned up, he is tranquil.\"\nThis nirvana is the goal of the disciples and the Independent Buddhas. Karma is eliminated, and the Arhat enters cessation. Samsara has been escaped. Unfortunately, this is not the proper goal. This is termed \"stationary nirvana\"; it is opposed to the \"nirvana in motion\" of the bodhisattva. In the latter case, nirvana and samsara are no different. One attains the great Awakening but remains in the saloon until everyone present there has also attained nirvana.\nLacking the compassion that motivates a bodhisattva, the Arhat in cessation can only be roused by a miracle. This is accomplished by the Buddha Amitabha, whose boundless light reaches even into this state. So roused by the Buddha Amitabha, one enters the Greater Vehicle."
49: "Now the yogi, fully confirmed on the path to Awakening, takes the first great initiation or empowerment into the supreme (anuttara) tantra. With this permission from the lama, himself empowered by the previous teacher in the lineage, one is qualified to receive the transmission of particular texts, and instructions as to their practice. Four initiations in all will sow the seeds for the yogi's eventual transformation, through the stages of the tantric bodhisattva path, into the Buddhahood in its four forms.\nThe first empowerment is called \"the flask\"; it will grow into the Emanation body of the Buddha (top row of the board), Buddhahood in the range of temporality.\nBefore the initiatory sections of the ritual, the yogi is caused to enter the mandala and to take (or reaffirm) the vows common to Mahayana and tantra: the resolution to win enlightenment for the benefit of all. Then he makes the tantric pledges, the fourteen and eight basic vows as well as the particular commitments entailed by the tantric cycle into which he is being initiated. Even before entering the mandala, the disciple must be purified by previous practice and specific ceremonies. A special \"flower garland\" initiation is performed; one determines the Buddha family of the initiate by throwing a flower on the mandala and determining in which direction it falls.\nThe main part of the ritual is the flask initiation. The flask is filled with amrta, nectar previously empowered by the deity and consisting of twenty­five substances compounded with water; this nectar purifies the body. If nonduality has not been attained by the flask initiation, one should contemplate at least that emptiness and bliss have been realized by the action."
50: "One receives the \"secret initiation\" into the supreme tantra, which wilI bear fruit as the great Enjoyment body of the Buddha. Here the initiating lama performs the activity, and the disciple is recipient of the benefits.\nAfter drawing the deities of the mandala into his own body, the lama performs the \"action seal\" (karma-mudra). He unites with wisdom (vidya) in the form of a woman. The term \"action seal\" is a description of this yoga. The available text, written by a fifteenth-century Gelugpa monk, states:\n\"The \"action\" or \"karma seal\" is so called because by the karma of previous lives one has been cast onto the body of a woman and reaches attainment there.  Whereas such actions as physical intercourse require no attention to meditation by oneself, but only the effectiveness of the actual seal, it is termed the \"action seal.\"\"\nWhen the semen, made molten by the fire of great passion, falls into the \"lotus\" of the \"mother\" and mixes with her red element, he achieves what is referred to as \"the conventional mandala of the thought of enlightenment.\" The resultant mixture is tasted by the united \"father-mother,\" and when it reaches the throat they can generate concretely a special bliss by which there is created in the disciple, who has been observing, an experience of the union of bliss and emptiness.\nThe author states that in his day a concrete vidya is not used. Instead, the disciple of keen faculties employs a knowledge seal (jnana-mudra), meaning a mental action, through his own visualization of the union.\nIn either case, whether a concrete or imagined action is affected, the bodhicitta - the drop resulting from union of semen and menstrual blood-is transferred to the yogi, who is at this point in his career quite expert in the mental creation of events. This empowers his corresponding mystic veins and centers to accomplish the Buddha's function of speech. The term \"secret initiation\" comes from the tasting of the secret substance."
51: "After many lifetimes of practice, one has encountered the Teacher and by his instructions become enlightened. Thus, one becomes a Buddhist saint, one who has \"slain the enemies\" (ari-han) of attachment, aversion, and bewilderment. One is worthy (arhat) of honor and reverence by human beings and by the gods. One is cool in danger, as the fragrant sandalwood to the ax. By spiritual understanding one has broken the eggshell of ignorance. The blue sky and the palm of one's hand are to one's mind the same.\nThe Arhat attains nirvana during his lifetime, but until death the body and mind remain as residues."
52: "Beginning the Greater Vehicle, one conceives the intention of reaching enlightenment for the sake of all living beings. This is the \"thought of awakening,\" bodhicitta, as yet only a vague intention, which will develop with practice into the enlightened mind. \"The Path of Accumulation is the morality of ordinary persons, the control of their senses, moderation in nourishment, watchfulness even during the early and later watches of the night, their energy, their calm and insight, their state of constant attention. It is also the merit acquired by other practices, the wisdom acquired by study, by reflection and by meditative cultivation (of what has been studied). By the development of these qualities one obtains receptivity to the comprehension (of the truth) and to liberation.\"\nBy practices of generosity, offerings, moral conduct, patience, vigor, and meditation one accumulates the merit that will bear fruit in the Enjoyment body of the Buddha. By the accumulation of study leading to wisdom one advances toward the attainment of the Dharma body.\nIn one's meditations one aims at gaining concentration of mind (samadhi) and the higher awarenesses (abhijna) that will enable one to more effectively understand the doctrine and to help others. Basic to concentration is the state of calm (samatha). Basic to calm are moral and devotional activities.\nOn this lower Path of Accumulation, one turns one's constant attentions to the four objects of mindfulness-body, feelings, thoughts, and dharmas - or to some other topic of meditation, either particular or abstract, that is appropriate to one's temperament."
53: "Having fortified one's resolve to reach full Awakening and to lead all others there, one continues to gather the equipment of merit and understanding. The grosser distractions become stilled, and meditation rises to an intermediate level on the way to concentration.\nOne cultivates the five roots \"conducive to liberation\"; faith in the Three Jewels, vigor in all practices, mindfulness of others, concentration free from discrimination between subject and object, and wisdom (the knowledge of dharmas and all their modifications). These gradually replace the five major obstacles to meditation: sense desire, ill will, laziness, agitation/ guilt, and doubt.\nOne exerts oneself in the four right efforts: to prevent the arising of unwholesome mental states, to abandon those that exist, to produce whole­ some mental states, and to nurture those that already exist.\nAt this stage, before the higher awarenesses have been obtained, one has only the intention of being useful to others, but one is able to do very little actual good. Therefore, it is of little benefit to teach or converse about the Dharma."
54: "Congratulations! You are irreversible! From this point you cannot fall to a lower destiny. Several benefits accrue from the attainment of and calm concentration. First, one develops the four bases of psychic power. The first basis is endowed with concentration from desire-to-do combined with effort, which is based upon detachment, dispassion, and cessation (of discursive thinking), dedicated to self-surrender. The last three bases are endowed with concentration from vigor, thought, and examination, respectively.\nUpon these bases one develops the higher awarenesses: the divine eye (to see all places in the universe), divine ear (to hear all sounds), knowledge of others' thoughts, knowledge of the past lives of oneself and others, and psychic powers. This last includes miraculous strength, radiation of light, transmutation of elements, and control over appearances (for example, the ability to create phantom bodies). These are considered prerequisites for preaching the Dharma.\nIn addition, one may enjoy the concentration called \"following the flow of Dharma\" (Dharma-srotanugata-samadhi), which enables one to travel to heavens and Buddha fields to audit the teachings of the various Buddhas and high bodhisattvas."
55: "Turning one's concentrated attention to the empty nature of reality, one develops the first of the \"wholesome roots conducive to penetration,\" designated as \"heat.\" This experience occurs also in the form of light, and the concentration characteristic of this stage is called \"that which has obtained the light of the Dharma\" (dharmaloka-labdha-samadhi). It is an examination of the doctrine so intensive that it generates heat and light, and the defilements burn away. In particular, one applies oneself to the idea that phenomena are not external realities but mental events and that their apparent characteristics are the result of discursive thought.\n\"Application\" in the title of this path refers to the application of one's meditative ability - the \"calm\" state of mind-to understanding the true nature of reality. In the Greater Vehicle, however, enlightenment is a function of compassion as well as of understanding. So, the yoga of this stage is described also in terms of one's relations with others:\n\"... those on the stage of  Heat  make all beings into  an  object [of their thoughts]:  their  thoughts  are  described  [first of all] as even [friendly, well-disposed, free from aversion, free from harm; and then] as tenfold [insofar as one regards all beings as if they were one's mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter, friend, relative, kinsman, or maternal relative].\""
56: "One's exertions on the path of yoga, giving rise to experiences of heat and light, reach their peak. This is the second of four \"roots of penetration,\" characterized by \"the concentration that expands the light (of the Dharma)\" (aloka-vrddhi-samadhi). The duality of subject and object has disappeared, and one is established in the understanding of \"thought only.\"\nThings are none other than reflections of mind. Even while dreaming, one looks upon ail dharmas as a dream. At this stage the object of perception is destroyed.  One understands the process of dependent origination in the Mahayana way: Not only is the living individual without an abiding principle or self, but so also are all phenomena \"selfless,\" in that they originate in dependency on one another, and ultimately on the fabricating mind. Not only is one's own rebirth derived from the twelvefold chain, but so also is the existence of the whole world.\nHere the physical and mental constituents of one's being have been replaced by the five cardinal virtues: faith, vigor, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom. One has control over natural events, being able to prevent natural catastrophes, put out fires, and exorcise demons. Realizing that the world is made by mind, one is enabled to control and reform it in accord with one's noble intentions.\nIn terms of his relationships with others, the yogi is not only purified, generous, and moral himself, but able to teach others to be so as well."
57: "The yogi takes the third initiation, known as \"wisdom-understanding\" (prajna-jnana), into the supreme tantra. Here the Jama, disciple, and wisdom lady (vidya,) having \"emerged from the experience of the common path as taught in the tantras\", and having blessed their streams of consciousness with mantras, accomplish the initiation of the disciple.\nThe initiation is given by a master fully qualified in such things as the \"sixty arts of love\" of the kama-Sastra literature. Now the disciple unites with the wisdom lady. During union he draws breath down into the middle vein. As the \"white element\" descends from forehead to neck, he experiences \"joy\"; as it reaches the heart, \"higher joy\"; the navel, \"special joy\"; and reaching the tip of the thunderbolt gem, without being emitted, he realizes \"spontaneous\" or \"co-emergent (saha-ja) bliss.\"\nPreferably the union should be done by visualization, with a knowledge seal-an imagined partner-rather than an actual woman, for the yogi at this stage has powers of visualization that can make the imagined act more real and effective than one performed physically.\nBy the internal union of the two symbols into the \"god of love,\" all duality comes to an end, and bliss-emptiness is achieved. The term \"coemergent\" bliss is used because bliss and emptiness are not two entities to be merged. The mind that experiences bliss from yogic practice becomes simultaneously the mind that understands the truth of emptiness. Bliss and emptiness merge together, like the pouring of water into water.\nEven if the bliss is not attained, the initiation implants seeds that, with later meditation on the Clear Light, will grow into the Buddha in his form as knowledge, the Dharma body, and the direct experience of emptiness."
58: "The final initiation of the disciple is termed \"the word,\" for here the guru explains to him how to understand the act of unification which was performed in the \"wisdom-understanding\" initiation. The guru says:\n\"During the third initiation, even if there was no concrete realization of the \"father-mother god of love\" (by means of the union) of your physical being with the vidya, yet from the corresponding state of mental clarity, there was the simultaneous emergence of a blissful-empty mind with the symbolic Clear Light. Just so, in the course of (practicing) the path according to this, having cut through to the focal points (cakras) in the body, after meditative cultivation, at the higher limit of the fourth stage (of joy), the body will actually become the vajra body (or) rainbow body which was attained through the very subtle mind and through (the realization that reality is) mind only. In addition, your mind also became the Clear Light whose object is the direct understanding of emptiness. These having been combined, the attainment of the union of body and mind in that way is known as \"union in (the process) of learning.\" By continuing to meditate along the same lines, one will attain the rank of the Buddha which is the \"union beyond learning.\"\"\nSuch is the highest worldly dharma of the tantric path. Like the teachings of the equivalent Mahayana level it is still \"worldly\" because it has been learned on the level of instruction or initiation, and has yet to be realized in practice."
59: "Ruled by a dynasty of tantric masters, Shambhala was originally converted by fierce bodhisattvas. The city sits by the Sita River (known also as the Tarim River in Central Asia), a stream so cold that it numbs the body. It is bordered by snowy mountains, and a thick forest lies between Shambhala and Tibet. The city is depicted in the shape of an eight-petaled lotus, and is crowded with wonderful buildings inhabited by tantric masters. At its center is the palace called Kalapa, south of which is the mandala of the Kalacakra tantra, constructed with precious stones by the first King Sucandra. This monarch also compiled the first texts of this tantra, based on instruction by the Buddha.\nThe Kalacakra propounds a system of liberation based on astrology. Among tantras it is most heavily imbued with external magic, for Shambhala is continually threatened by the Turkish Muslims. The twenty-fifth King, named Ferocious Wheel (drag-po 'khor-lo), will in the year 2327 defeat these religious enemies in a Buddhist Armageddon. At one time there were hopes that this King was the Russian Czar. In any case, the battle is depicted in paintings of Shambhala.\nFor yogis Shambhala is, with Urgyan and Potala, a source of inspiration, a mystic land of the Dharma that is not so far away as to be unattainable. One pilgrim, however, seeking the way to Shambhala through trackless wastes, encountered a cave-dwelling yogi who asked him, \"Where are you going through these deserts of snow?\"\n\"I want to see Shambhala,\" the pilgrim replied.\n\"Then don't go far; in your own heart is the kingdom of Shambhala.\""
60: "Visiting this island paradise off the South Indian coast, one encounters the high bodhisattvas Tara and Avalokitesvara. Besides the journey of the hero of the Gandavyuha Sutra, there are records of several visits. The great pilgrim-scholar Hsuan Tsang described the dangerous passes and steep cliffs of the mountain retreat. On top, he said, is a lake whose waters are clear as a mirror. By it is the abode of Avalokitesvara. From the lake flows a mighty river that circles the mountain twenty times on its way to the sea.\nThe people of the island on which the mountain is located have no special religion, yet they use magic to protect their homes. On the island are a number of smaller mountains with rock-crystal peaks and caves of diamond with high ceilings.\nGeography is not the only barrier to Potala; it seems that one's religious practice plays some role in gaining access. When the great philosopher­ poet and grammarian Candragomin set sail from India, bound to the magic island, a huge sea naga (the envious grammarian Patanjali) caused a great storm to threaten the ship. From within the sea he roared to the captain, \"Throw out Candragomin.\" But Candragomin prayed to Lady Tara, who arrived with an escort, all riding garuda birds, and frightened away the sea serpents.\nIn another tale, two yogis go there together. At the foot of the mountain, Tara sits teaching some nagas; but the yogis see only an old woman tending cows. On the side of the mountain she is teaching asuras and yaksas; they see a girl tending goat and sheep. At the top they find nothing but a stone image of Avalokitesvara. One yogi thinks, \"This must be due to my faults of perception.\" Evoking the deities by meditation, he meets them and receives teachings. The other yogi meditates with little conviction and attains only the power of levitation. Even this he loses when on the way back he grows angry with his companion.\nAvalokitesvara and Tara are the patron bodhisattvas of Tibet, the former embodied in the lineage of Dalai Lamas. Thus, the mountain palace in Lhasa, which was their residence, is called the Potala."
61: "The magic land of the dakinis is located in the upper reaches of the modern Swat River Valley in Pakistan. A breeding ground for tantric Buddhism, it is identified especially with the supreme tantric cycle known as the Secret Assembly (guhya-samaja). This tantra has been promulgated as the path for those of strong passions and attachment to the world of sense:\n\"By the enjoyment of all sense desires, And gratification just as one pleases, By just such yoga as this, One may quickly gain Buddhahood.\"\nThis is twilight language, indicating in conventional terms the mystic transmutation effected by yogic practice. By such promises, couched in symbolism, the ignorant are attached to the Dharma.\nThe lake at Urgyan was at first inhabited by nagas. They were con­ verted by the bodhisattva Vajrapani and given the tantras, written with lapis lazuli on leaves of gold. The nagas became heroes and sky walkers (dakas and dakinis, \"warlocks and witches\"), and built a city on the shores of the lake. The precious guru Padmasambhava was born in a lotus in that lake after the prayer of King Indrabhuthi, who desired a son.\nUrgyan and its Palace of Lotus Light was a popular pilgrimage site in the Middle Ages. The yogi known as Urgyan-pa has left an account of his visit there, during which he was instructed by the dakini Vajra-yogini in the form of a prostitute's daughter."
62: "Having mastered the wisdom of the noble Brahmanical tradition, one's state is symbolized by the wish-granting jewel. One has grown powerful, a virtual lord of creation, at one with the great gods Brahma, Vishnu, or Shiva. The vidya of which one is master is the knowledge of the Vedas, for all the Hindu practices, whether seeking welfare by sacrifice and burned offering, sun worship or devotionalism, dance, philosophy, logic, grammar, drugs, asceticism, yogic meditation, or merely keeping one's place in the caste system (karma yoga), seek their legitimacy in that timeless revelation. From the Buddhist point of view, they are all related in their ignorance of the impermanent nature of all conditioned things, and their attempt to discover an abiding self in the individual and the world.\nThis tradition is one of great attainment. With wholesome action the devotee eradicates the grosser of the defilements, thus warranting the con­ quest of the wish-granting jewel. By strenuous meditation the yogi may rise through the trances to the very peak of existence. But for their attachment to the existence of certain entities - God and the soul-the Hindu is doomed to continued rebirth. There is only one means to complete freedom from attachment, and that is the understanding of the ultimate emptiness of all phenomena."
63: "One approaches a direct and personal experience of the highest truths, firmly positioned in one's acceptance of the Four Noble Truths and one's commitment to the welfare of others. The yogi obtains the concentration that enters partially into the meaning of reality (tattvarthaika-de­sanupravesa). Fortified by energy and concentration, he greatly enjoys consideration of the doctrine, in expectation that it will soon be fully understood. Each truth is realized first by acceptance, then by understanding. Here also the five cardinal virtues-faith, vigor, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom-become unshakable forces in one's stream of being. One is receptive to the doctrine without the constraints posed by distractedness, doubt, and conceptualizing thought. This stage represents the dispersion of the \"subject\" side of the subject object duality.\nAs a film projector creates the appearance of objects that do not really exist, so should one experience reality."
64: "One arrives at the stage of \"unimpeded thought\" (anantarya-citta-samadhi). Immediately upon its release from subject-object dichotomizing, the mind rises to a direct and unhindered confrontation with the emptiness of all dharmas.\nOne now has all the equipment, plus the skill in its use, necessary for full Awakening. The stage of \"coursing in faith\" (adhimukti-carya) is completed. One's own enlightenment is assured; ahead is the activity of the bodhisattva to alleviate the misery of others: skillful means conjoined with wisdom in the great mission."
65: "One has accomplished the way of the primeval Shen, the sorcerer of old who brought Bon doctrine to Tibet. The \"wisdom\" one holds is the companion with whom one attains Awakening. She is \"youthful and well endowed like a tree of paradise. Her good qualities emerge everywhere like leaves and fruit and flowers, producing all the things that one desires.\" She is virtuous and compassionate, and above all difficult to find. In her \"space and knowledge, Method and Wisdom, the channels, vital breath and vital fluid, all flow together.\" Grasping this perfect woman in ceremonial meditation one attains the vidya, \"original knowledge,\" by which creation was originally emanated from mind. One also obtains psychic skill (nyamsrtsal), the equivalent of Buddhist siddhi, which is \"measureless like the sky,\" \"unpredictable like a child's,\" \"undirected like a madman's,\" \"like a bold lion,\" and which \"brings all conduct into accord with anything whatsoever.\"\nIn short, the Shen, the master of Bon, is a Taoist sage with tantric overlay, and this is the highest point of the non-Buddhist paths."
66: "Upon one is now conferred the first initiation of a vajra-master (vajracarya). Having gone through the course of the tantras as a disciple, one will now be made qualified as a teacher. First is conferred the initiation by water, cleansing the remaining defilements of physical activity that obstruct the way to full Buddhahood. One is enabled to see the Buddhas in many Buddha fields, to create emanation bodies \"for those who need instruction, and to convert living beings by the performance of miracles.\"\nThe ten bodhisattva stages on the tantric path are likened to the process of death and rebirth. Previous to death, one accumulated the karma that will regulate the next life-in this case the taking of refuge in the faith, the bodhisattva vow, making offerings, moral conduct, study, and meditation. The moment of death is like those ritual meditations that brought one close to an understanding of emptiness: Death and the intermediate state (bardo, antarabhava) are like the Path of Application. Entering the womb is the mental generation of deity in the ritual meditation. The ten lunar months in the womb are the ten stages of the bodhisattva path. Birth from the womb is emergence into the full Awakening of Buddhahood. So, one's previous practice on the paths of Accumulation and Application are the past karma giving rise to this supreme accomplishment, and the ten initiations are its maturation in the womb."
67: "One becomes a vidyadhara equal in accomplishment (siddhi) with the gods of the Realm of Sense Desire. In addition to the ability to pacify, increase, subjugate, and destroy-the lower of the worldly siddhis-and the eight occult powers (listed at No. 72), one can also fly through the sky and make oneself invisible. One's body appears like that of a sixteen-year­ old, and all one's desires appear from the sky.\nThe vidya, simply speaking, is a female mantra. The holders of vidya, \"occult science,\" are known in Indian literature, Buddhist and non­Buddhist, from several centuries B.C. The vidyadharas live in cities in the snowy mountains north of India. They can fly and change shapes, and occasionally come down to intermarry with ordinary people. Tibetan historians consider them the original tantra masters among humanity; it is said the vidyadharas kept their wisdom secret until society had been prepared for its reception by the acceptance of the sutras of the Greater Vehicle. So the collection of tantras is called the \"collection of the vidyadharas\" (vidya­dhara-pitaka), to distinguish it from the \"collection of the sutras\" and that of the monastic discipline (vinaya-pitaka). Nonetheless, in ancient times the sutra and vinaya masters were just as shy as were ordinary people of these \"siddha gods\" and their strange magic.\nThe forest of the vidyadharas is called \"white cloud sounding everywhere the voice of the wandering mountain streams.\" They are described as \"not quite peaceful and not quite wrathful ... impressive, overpowering, majestic.\" Their monarch is a tantric Wheel-Turning King."
68: "These radiant and powerful figures have mastered all the magic of the long-lived gods. Their abode is called the \"Pure (land) of the Astronauts\" (dag-pa mkha'-spyod). By mastering the vidya spell they can prolong their life span for many ages. So subtle is the materiality of their forms that they enjoy all of space; they are astronauts who fly about the universe. Like the yogi in a high state of trance or the gods of the Realm of Form, they are aloof from the world and far beyond the enjoyment of objects of sense, which is gained from the lower siddhis by worldly vidyadharas. From the practice of tantric \"yoga-without-images,\" dwelling in the sound of the mantra without specific visualization, they attain a state of pure calm and insight."
69: "As emperor of the vidyadharas, one has attained the highest of worldly siddhis: universal sovereignty and recognition. This is the state of the ordinary Wheel Turning King raised to a spiritual plane. Here the distinction between \"path of graduation\" and \"path of study\" ceases to be effective, for whatever is studied is immediately realized. The tantric Wheel Turning King performs the activities of a great tantric scholar:\n\"In short, wherever. he went, he used to read all available sacred texts, long or short. Everyday, he used to expand the ocean of his Mind, completely filled with the games of knowledge. He became a great scholar similar to the king of precious gems, fulfilling the desires of all living beings, headed by those who possessed a strong wish for emancipation.\"\nHe combines doctrine and meditation in his teachings, and demonstrates the path in the example of his own attainments. With occult powers he converts those who have faith in demonstration of miracles."
70: "One visits the realm of Amoghasiddhi, \"effective attainment,\" the northern Buddha field. This is the karma family of tantric practice. Activity is powerful, even destructive; its correspondence in unpurified life is jealousy; its prevailing color is green. But here the forces of passionate activity are turned toward effecting-the destruction of hindrances and attaining the ends of Dharma. Action is precise, powerful, and complete.\nAmoghasiddhi's element is wind. He holds a multicolored total vajra and makes the gesture of protection. His consort is Faithful Tara, who guarantees one's tantric vows (samaya-tara); the two ride on a garuda bird. Vajrapani, \"vajra-in-hand,\" is the bodhisattva of this realm; his function is appropriate compulsion."
71: "One enters the ten stages of the bodhisattva path, as elaborated in the­ sutras, the scriptures of the Greater Vehicle. At each stage the bodhisattva emphasizes one of the ten perfections of the path. Here he practice's liberality, the perfection of which is the giving of instruction in the true Dharma.\n\"Rejoicing\" (pramudita) is the name given to the first level, for here the bodhisattva sees that enlightenment is not far distant, and with it the welfare of all. Like the purification of gold, his or her glory and value will gradually increase with progress through the stages.\n\"Rejoicing\" is the bodhisattva's equivalent to the Path of Vision. Insight into the selflessness of personality and of dharmas provides a vision of the identity of self and others. There is no thought for oneself; he makes a great renunciation of worldly matters and is no longer distracted by the five common fears: concern for livelihood, reputation, death, future rebirth, and shyness at gatherings.\nThe bodhisattva makes a firm commitment to the thought of enlightenment and develops compassion for those caught in the cycle of rebirth.\nHe makes a set of aspirations: to revere the Buddhas, uphold the doctrine, emulate - the events of the Buddha's life, accomplish the course of the bodhisattva, mature all living beings, perceive the extent of samsara, purify adorn Buddha realms, become precise and effective in all actions, and accomplish the great Awakening by demonstrating the deeds of the Buddha his last existence ( the top row of the board).\nIn preparing for this great mission the bodhisattva gathers spiritual and worldly knowledge. He practices the concentrations, the emanation of physical forms, and the performance of miracles. Like the leader of a caravan, he gathers provisions and solicits the advice of experienced travelers. Thus, he also \"rejoices\" in mapping out the journey."
72: "One has taken the path of siddhi, magical attainment, as opposed to that of study. By meditative ritual (sadhana) one practices the eight worldly attainments:\n1. with the sword, invincibility;\n2. with eye ointment, sight of the world from the heavens down;\n3. with foot ointment, swiftness;\n4. with magical pills, the ability to shape oneself in a tiny ball;\n5. the elixir of youth;\n6. the power of taking any form;\n7. passing through barriers;\n8. power over treasures and spirits under the earth.\nThese constitute the ordinary attainments; the extraordinary ability is, of course, Buddhahood, which requires meditation specifically on emptiness and not mere ritual service of divinity.\nSome lamas consider these siddhi as equivalent to the Path of Accumulation. Others insist that one follow the orthodox tantric path."
73: "Rising to the second stage of the path to becoming a vajra master, one takes the initiation of the jewel-studded crown. This will bear fruit such as the head-bump (usnisa) and other physical characteristics of the Buddha. One is thereby purified of physical karma, of misfortune, disease, deadening demons, and impediments to meditation. Indifferent to worldly gain and honor, yet filled with compassion, one is suited to become a universal ruler."
74: "One receives the vajra initiation of a tantric master, which accomplishes the nondiscursive understanding that is characteristic of the Buddha's mind. One is freed from all traces of belief in an ego (atman) and is more than a match for the rival teachers of other traditions"
75: "The initiation of the bell, female energy topped by a vajra, fulfills in one the ability to teach all the eighty-four thousand ways of practicing the Dharma, particular to all the types of living beings in all their situations. One is now authorized to perform the verbal functions of a Buddha and to have one's instructions regarded as those of the fully Awakened."
76: "The southern pure land is that created by Ratnasambhava, \"source of jewels.\" He is the lord of the wish granting gem, and fulfills the Buddha's function of giving what is needed. His steed is a horse, his color yellow, his element the earth, expansive and fertile. The understanding associated with this state is that of \"equality,\" for all things are equal on the broad earth; it counteracts pride and cupidity. Ratnasambhava is embraced by Mamaki, who represents fertilizing water; his bodhisattvas are named Element of Space (akasa-garbha) and Wholly Benevolent (samanta-bhadra)."
77: "You have reached the pure land of Amitabha, \"boundless light,\" the land of lotus ponds and magnificent palaces in which one's ordinary needs are fulfilled and one is able to hear while seated in a lotus, the teachings of Buddhas, at the merest wish.\nThe creation of this purified field is the result of a great vow made by the bodhisattva Dharmakara, \"source of the Dharma,\" to create a pure space to which all creatures could attain. As Amitabha Buddha he descends to the believer at the time of death or, as the Tibetans prefer,  projects a hook of light, which draws the person's consciousness-about the size of a seed-from his heart to dissolve in the heart of the Buddha and emanate from there to birth in a lotus flower.\nAmitabha is an Emanation body; the corresponding Enjoyment body is Amitayus, \"infinite life\"-propitiated for longevity; the Dharma body is Ananta-prabha, \"boundless illumination.\" Amitabha sits in concentration holding a begging bowl in his lap, and may be taken to represent the Buddha's illumination under the bodhi tree. He is red; his family is the lotus and represents the transmutation of passion into compassion, for the beautiful, scented lotus has its roots in mud and slime. His understanding is termed \"discriminative.\"\nAmitabha's mount is the peacock, his consort the White-robed Lady pandara-vasini); the chief bodhisattvas of his family are Avalokitesvara, the great compassionate lord who looks over Tibet, and Maha-sthama-prapta, \"one attained to great strength.\" They are warm and open to everyone."
78: "At this stage, called \"the Flaming\" (arcis-mati), the various factors of enlightenment shine with great heat, burning off the remaining emotional and intellectual mist. The bodhisattva practices vigor in tandem with wisdom. He retreats to the forest and intensifies his meditation-examining the body, sensory organs, feelings, thoughts, and various phenomena of the inner and outer world. By ascetic warmth (tapas) he stills his desires and learns to be content with whatever exists. Nurturing a disgust for sense desires, he is purified by a stringent mode of life. There is no timidity nor faintheartedness in his practice. Nor is there attachment to the literary and artistic forms of the Dharma. As the noble Asanga puts it, \"'he has the conceit of having abolished Dharma,' inasmuch as he has abolished the conceit of there being varieties of Dharmas-'sutras' and so forth.\" He is nonpartisan and not opinionated. Yet he holds firmly to the middle way, rejecting the twin notions that everything is unreal and that everything truly exists. Both emotional and intellectual appropriation have thoroughly ceased.\nHere the bodhisattva is like gold worked into an ornament. Intensive ascetic practices, combined with the wisdom of nonappropriation and the \"middle way\" between philosophic extremes, have perfected his moral conduct and attitude toward the world. Intensive meditation grants incredible supernatural powers, yet he is humble and pleasant to be with, mild and soft-spoken, splendid by nature, a shining example of his own teachings."
79: "At the stage called \"Illuminating\" (prabha-kari), the bodhisattva com­ bines patience with the perfection of wisdom. That is to say, he will endure anything for the sake of the Dharma. He will walk through a thousand fires to hear the doctrine, and be patient enough to remain in samsara to teach. Examining impermanence, he understands the suffering and burning of the world. He sees his own lives for ages past and the comings and goings of others, He sees how instruction in the Dharma shines from the Dharma­dhatu and resolves to use it to help others without any thought of reward. He truly lives the Dharma, day and night; he is elated by a well-turned phrase as though he had found a jewel. His life is total abandonment in service of the Dharma. His patience and gentleness with others are infinitely refined.\nAs the weight of gold is not diminished by its burning and purification, so the second-stage bodhisattva's moral qualities do not decrease, even though his specialty now is patience, His meditative attainments flourish. Lord of the Realm of Desire, he can grasp the sun and the moon or shake the earth, become one or many, appear and disappear, fly while seated cross-legged, walk on water, and blaze like fire."
80: "On the \"Immaculate\" (vimala) ground the bodhisattva is freed from all the stains of ethical violations. He perfects the practice of morality by combining it with wisdom. Thus, he abstains from the ten unwholesome actions-killing, stealing, and so forth-and substitutes their opposites with a life giving, generously compassionate attitude combined with the most skillful of means. Yet he also appreciates the Dharma dhatu as the highest value.\nThe bodhisattva at this stage can produce a thousand concentrations, emanations, and miracles as others before, but now all in a single moment."
81: "The yogi receives the initiation of permission (anujna), and the name he or she will bear upon reaching Buddhahood. The recipient is handed the bell and vajra-female and male, wisdom and means-the two tools of tantric practice. Thus, he becomes a qualified teacher in his own right. Hereafter he is known by his initiation name. One has completed the \"Path of Maturation\" and is free to teach and confer initiations in accordance with one's vows and the rules surrounding transmission of the Dharma. All the qualities necessary for Buddhahood have been attained, and one enters upon the functions of the Buddha. The next bodhisattva stages are those of the \"liberated path.\""
82: "Having learned in previous stages to convert phenomena] existence into the forms of Buddhahood, one now brings to fulfillment, by intensive meditation, the four initiations of the supreme tantra. First one visualizes the deity in a rough and fine way. \"Rough\" refers to the limbs of the deity and \"fine\" to their placement on one's own body. The psychic winds are then roused to enter the central channel, and they dissolve therein. Concentration is centered in the heart focal point. When the heart knot is unraveled, the process of fulfillment will unfold itself."
83: "The secret mind, which is equivalent to that of the Buddha in its understanding of emptiness, comes to experience bliss and emptiness in union. Guided by yoga in accord with previous initiations, it realizes a facsimile of the Clear Light. The process is known in three steps as \"the light,\" \"the spread of light,\" and \"the culmination of light.\""
84: "One has attained the highest place in the world and the most exalted Buddha field. Here in the Vajra-dhatu Palace sit tenth-stage bodhisattvas, great heroes who have attained the vajra-like concentration. They are given final instruction by the Buddhas, who have the awesome form of the Enjoyment body.\nIn this heaven dwell the highest gods of the Pure Abodes, surrounding and worshiping the Diamond-element Palace. Inside gather the Buddhas of all directions with their retinue of high bodhisattvas, whom they guide into the blissful-empty state of the supreme tantra. The aim of yogis on earth is to merge with these bodhisattvas and take the teachings as well, identifying themselves with the mysterious body, speech, and mind of the Buddhas by means of ritual gesture (mudra), mantra, and concentration, respectively.\nThis realm is pictured in a lotus, the symbol of timeless purity."
85: "One visits the eastern land of the Buddha Aksobhya, the \"unshakable one.\" Abhirati has been shown on earth by the great layman-bodhisattva Vimalakirti, \"Immaculate Fame,\" as one would show a wreath of flowers. Surrounded by mountains, this realm is filled with lovely lakes, hills and knolls, waterfalls, and ponds whose banks are sprinkled with gold dust. There are groves of gem trees, filled with singing birds and red flowers, which drop scented tissues and delicious foods. The inhabitants dwell in tents ornamented with precious articles; lotus flowers spring up at every step.\nAksobhya is depicted in full lotus; he might be said to embody the Buddha's conquest of Mara under the bodhi tree. Aksobhya sits under his bodhi tree in Abhirati, \"in the midst of an assembly vast as the sea, and preaches there the Dharma. When  this pure land  is  thus brought to earth by Vimalakirti, three precious ladders rise from it to the heaven of the Thirty-three; on these ladders, the gods of the Thirty-three descend to see, venerate, and serve the Buddha Aksobhya and to hear the Dharma; on these ladders, the people of Jambu Island mount to the heaven of the Thirty-three to visit the gods.\"\nAksobhya himself is imperturbable; he touches the earth to witness his conquest of the hindrances. His mount is the elephant; his color blue; his family that of the Vajra, more solid than anything else. The emotional equivalent (in the defiled state) is hatred, transmuted here into mirrorlike wisdom, \"calm and uncritical,\" symbolized by the reflective quality of water. His consort is Buddha-locana, \"Eye of Awakening.\" The bodhisattva of this space is Vajrasattva, the \"adamantine  being,\" the  tantric form of a bodhisattva."
86: "On this level, called \"Far Reaching\" (durarmgama), the bodhisattva does immense works for the welfare of others. His perceptions and abilities are oceanic. He fulfills each of the perfections in each moment and in wide spaces of the universe. He creates pure fields in which living beings can thrive and develop their spiritual lives. He courses in his own practices and makes great strides in his knowledge of technique and supernatural powers.\nThe perfection of the Far Reaching stage is skill in means. The literary and artistic skills of Stage 5 now occur spontaneously and without thought or effort. He demonstrates the ways of the disciples and the independent Buddhas, as well as that of the bodhisattva, making no distinction of vehicles when it comes to the maturation of others. Now he is greater than the two lesser enlightened personages, the arhat and prateyekabuddha, in fact as well as intention. Previously his vow to affect the liberation of all beings placed him in the nobler class, much as a young prince is potentially more powerful than his mature ministers. Now that wisdom has been perfected, he is greater in his own right. He enters into nirvana and returns in every moment; while remaining within samsara he experiences its transcendence. This is the \"nirvana-in-motion,\" infinitely greater than the \"Cessation\" of the Lesser Vehicle (No. 48) because it continues to function in the world for the sake of the multitudes. Yet the bodhisattva strives for further greatness.\nThe seventh-stage bodhisattva resembles gold set with all manner of jewels, the most splendid of ornaments. Like the sun, he outshines all other luminary bodies, drying off the moisture of the defilements and maturing fields of grain that are sentient beings."
87: "\"Face to Face\" (abhimukhi) with reality, the bodhisattva stands neither in samsara nor in nirvana. He realizes that phenomena are neither pure nor impure in themselves; they can only be judged in  relationship  with others. He does not desire the peace of the Arhat or of the Independent Buddha, yet he is freed from rebirth. \"When coming intentionally into birth he is protected there against the subtlest defilements (the samklesas).\" The basis of his life is not the defiled body-mind but the six perfections; generosity, moral conduct, patience, vigor, and meditation, all crowned by wisdom.\nWisdom perfects all the other practices of the bodhisattva; it is defined as understanding the principle of dependent origination. Observing the course of events, their arising and cessation, he notes that all worldly business arises from attachment to the self. Without this attachment there would be no ordinary and miserable existence. By that ignorant longing for being and or nonbeing, people follow wrong paths of action; they plant the seeds of habit and inclination, which result in continued rebirth, followed inevitably by old age, sickness, misery, and death, Ignorance is the field for planting; the conceit that \"I exist\" is fertilizing moisture. So, the sprout of the organism-body and mind-grows and develops sensory organs.  As these meet each other there is contact, and thus perceptions, sensations, and the thirst for an impossible satisfaction. From that comes a clinging to existence; then rebirth; and from rebirth, suffering and death. He sees that the six destinies of living beings follow from ignorant activity. He understands that the world is mind only. Seeing further that this aggregate, or tree, of suffering grows without a real doer or experiencer, he reasons that no -action can exist either in the absolute sense, for action requires an actor. Thus, he meditates on the emptiness of all phenomena.\nThe sixth-stage bodhisattva glows like gold ornamented by beryl. As moonlight cools the body on a summer's night, his luster assuages the burning of those tormented by attachment and passion."
88: "At this stage, \"Very Difficult to Conquer\" (sudurjaya), the bodhisattva accomplishes what is truly hard to do: He becomes a guide for living beings without becoming affected by their intractability. The characteristic perfection of this level is meditation. His memory is infallible, and so the Dharma-dhatu, the \"principle of Dharma,\" is successfully reduced to the traditional formulations of truth. He can teach in terms of the Four Noble Truths-suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the path-and in terms of the two levels of truth, the relative and the absolute. He composes treatises on scripture, on the arts and sciences such as medicine and astrology that are conducive to human welfare; provides gardens and theatrical entertainments for the edification of others; and refutes the wrong views of less fruitful religious traditions. But he also knows the essential principle of reality, and for the fifth-stage bodhisattva there is no causality; the elements of reality are not seen as diverse but as being of the same nature, unoriginated, purified from the outset, free of mental conceptualization, beyond words, like a magic spell, a play, a dream, a reflection, or an echo.\nThe bodhisattva is now generally a monk or a nun; in associating with householders, he feels no envy of their situation or desire for gain. He is amazed at their lack of revulsion from samsara and appalled at how they fuel the machines of continuing misery. He pities their bewilderment and confusion, but without arrogance or conceit, for he knows all streams of consciousness to be ultimately equal. He is skilled in showing them the Dharma as a guide.\nThe fifth-stage bodhisattva shines like purified gold adorned with semi­precious stones, or like the mansion of stars and planetary bodies that cannot be shaken off course by any wind. In short, he unites transcendental wisdom with the techniques of working in the world."
89: "From the psychic winds and the understanding of \"mind only\" is produced the apparitional body, still impure because it is not immersed in the Clear Light and directly confronting the innate emptiness of mind.\n \nThe impure illusory body of the womb-gate\nAnd the pure form of Buddha's body\nAre one in the great light of Bardo.\nSon, this is the Bardo of Accomplishment!"
90: "The illusory body is purified by two trances: the contraction of winds in the heart, and their expansion into the Clear Light, which illumines the direct understanding of emptiness.\n\"He entered the gate [of initiation] and began to contemplate, and he gained possession of a body of form which was \"appearance and Emptiness.\" He was without outer or inner, above or below, front or rear, before or after; he was unmade, unlimited, undivided; he was without essence in appearance, without bias in Light, without defilement in Bliss; his glow was the Clear Light, his nature the unproduced, his prowess manifold. And in this realm of undefiled Great Bliss he saw the play-the residence and its residents, gods and goddesses, dakas and dakinis-the subtle and self-sprung understanding, the miraculous knowledge. All events-inner and outer-were the appearance of his mind, occurring  as the manifold process of his understanding.\nFrom the moment he gained this appearance and Emptiness he penetrated it as the Clear Light, unconstrued, un­ fathomable, empty of arising, abiding, and perishing; he comprehended the natural pace of his ordinary knowledge as a genuine and innate nature, and whatever appeared as the play of the Dharma Body, Bliss and Emptiness, the pith of conditioned coproduction...\nIn this state he purified away subject and object, and he perfected his prowess of great knowledge; as an attainment from this realm of the Clear Light of contemplation, from then on he knew that whatever occurred-at the very  moment of its appearance-was itself light and itself clarity, unfathomable, unproduced, the nature of Great Bliss, self-sprung, self-erected.\nHe realized many \"gateways to contemplation\": the shining of gems, the lamp of gems, the shining of the moon, the lamp of the sun, the seeing of all things. There appeared in his mind endless insights, visions, supernormal powers, and signs of success, such that I cannot write them down, they were so many and so extraordinary.\""
91: "Contemplating the Clear Light whose substance is emptiness, one now achieves the real and well-learned unification (yuganaddha) of the body­the illusory, mind-made body-and the mind that is Clear Light. This is virtually the Enjoyment body of the Buddha, here experienced as a tenth­stage tantric bodhisattva. Just beyond this stage, rising beyond the world, is full Buddhahood, the unification beyond learning, the realm of the pure Dharma body. Yet the yogi, because he or she is impelled by compassion for others, remains in the world to manifest in the activities of a fully qualified vajra teacher."
92: "Now one performs the functions of the Buddha on the highest level, initiating tenth-stage bodhisattva great-heroes into the highest levels of truth. This form of the Buddha is called the \"communal\" or \"meeting\" body (sku sprod-pa), for it is the sustaining power of the Buddhist community on its most purified stage, or the \"enjoyment body,\" for it represents the fruit of the lengthy accumulation of merit and understanding. This body bears the thirty-two major and eighty minor marks of the Buddha: lines on his hands and feet depicting a wheel, golden skin, trunk like a lion, shoulders gently curved, hairs each curling clockwise, and so forth; it is depicted with ornaments of gold. In this form the Buddha teaches only the doctrines of the Greater Vehicle, sutras and tantras, and only in a purified field, the Supreme Heaven Akanistha. But like the sun and its rays, the enjoyment body radiates other forms, called emanation bodies, which are adapted to the ways of the world."
93: "Like the sun, the Dharma body appears from behind the obscurations, produced from the path of Dharma. This is the great Awakening, the essence of Buddhahood. It is composed of the qualities of the Buddha, the powers and so forth, deriving from great compassion, and the two sorts of wisdom: absolute wisdom, which knows the emptiness of all phenomena­ into which the bodhisattva has merged \"like water poured into water, or oil dissolved into oil\"-and relative knowledge, which is omniscience.\nYet these terms for the Dharma body and such attributes as \"wisdom\" are only descriptive, for it is beyond names; it is unborn and ineffable; it is not really produced, for it has always been all-pervading and needs only be realized. \"One experiences the Dharma-kaya, joyful, equal to the sky, for only one instant: at the time of (1) death, (2) a faint, (3) going to sleep, (4) yawning, and (5) coitus.\"\nThe Dharma body does not exist, for its essence is as empty as that of all other dharmas; it does not nonexist, because this nature of emptiness is real. It is one, since the duality of \"self\" and \"other\" is a fiction; it is manifold, because many persons attain it, and relatively speaking, there are many Buddhas."
94: "The bodhisattva has become a \"cloud of Dharrna\" (Dharma-megha); his body is clothed with countless concentrations and magical formulas as the sky is filled with clouds. He lets fall a rain of Dharma to extinguish the glow of defilement still burning creatures below.\nThe practice here perfected is that of understanding, which means omniscience. All six higher awarenesses are his: divine eye, divine ear, mind reading, knowledge of former lives, psychic powers, and the knowledge that his passions are extinguished. From every pore of his skin emanate innumerable Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and so forth down to the least conspicuous teachers.\nWith rays of light the Buddhas initiate the tenth-stage bodhisattva into their own status, consecrating his sovereignty over the world. For now, his practice of the high awarenesses and all his other actions pose no obstruction to his control over karma.\nThe tenth-stage bodhisattva is like a golden ornament made by a divine artisan for the king of the gods, studded with precious jewels and absolutely incomparable in splendor. So, the great bodhisattvas of this stage are pictured with golden ornaments on their bodies: the compassionate Avalokitesvara, savioress Tara, learned Manjusri, and benevolent Samantabhadra. The length of their course on the path is tremendous; all of this has taken three \"countless ages,\" each comprising 10^59 years. The first age reaches to the first bodhisattva stage, the second age through the seventh. Now these great heroes are fitted to assume the Dharma body, or to join the Buddha's retinue in the highest heaven."
95: "This plane is called \"right intellect\" (sadhu-mati); one acquires the ability to teach the Dharma appropriate to all the aspects of a situation. The bodhisattva teaches like a Buddha. He or she can lecture on Dharma utilizing the four complete and specialized perspicacities (pratisamvid): knowledge of dharmas, meaning systems, etymology, and eloquence. He can speak in several languages and tones of voice simultaneously, making direct explanations suited to the various capacities of the members of his audience, and answer several questions at the same time. The perfection here is \"power,\" but especially the ability to speak, including the power of the dharanis, which congeal the essence of the sutras and imbue their bearer with magical forces.\nThe bodhisattva's halo is like a golden ornament on the neck of a Wheel-turning King."
96: "At the \"unshakeable\" (acala) level, the bodhisattva ceases conscious striving for perfection. He enters the effortless state of the Dharma realm, no longer distinguishing states of mind that perceive the characteristics of things from those that perceive their sameness. He stands for no ideology, knowing that reality is beyond ideas, and enjoys the full acceptance of Emptiness with no distinction of \"pure\" and \"impure,\" wholesome or un wholesome, among ideas and practices. His state is total equanimity. He takes no special worldly or spiritual form, not even that of a bodhisattva. Like a sleeping man who was dreaming that he had fallen into a river and was struggling to get out, and then awakes, the bodhisattva is suddenly relieved of all striving and anxiety.\nIn this situation the bodhisattva must be held to continued existence by outside influences. The Buddhas intervene to remind him of his vows. Even if the state of peace and liberation has been attained, he must continue to act for the benefit of others. The nonconceptual essence of Dharma, they point out to him, is permanent, whether people become fully Awakened to it or not; in fact, the Awakened state is attained by lesser beings, such as disciples and independent Buddhas. But only the full Buddhas, with their insight into the nature of things combined with worldly knowledge and skills, can work to affect the Awakening of others. They urge him to com pare their own advanced development, their crowds of disciples, pure lands, and innumerable lights of Dharma, with his own single lamp of illumination. He must, they point out again, come to fulfill his vows by developing the qualities of a perfect Buddha. Finally, they confer upon him the prediction of his Buddhahood and its time and place.\nSo, the eighth-stage bodhisattva develops the ten powers of the Buddha; those over length of life, state of mind, necessities, karma, manner of birth, creative imagination, the bodhisattva resolution, miracles, under­ standing, and Dharma discourse. He attains mastery over the realm that will become his Buddha field. This stage represents the fulfillment of his vows.\nThe bodhisattva's deeds are now thoughtless and spontaneous: they never fail. His dharani spells always protect. Indeed, all his deeds are like a magic spell. His methods are extended to embrace all the ways of teachings. Previous stages are likened to a boat going slowly overland toward the sea. Now he has entered the water and crosses vast distances quickly and easily, impelled by the wind of his resolution to save all living beings.\nThe eighth-stage bodhisattva is like an ornament of gold worn on the neck of a king. He approaches the omniscience of the Buddha, knowing all the intricacies of the world system, such as its size and age, down to each atomic particle within it. He appears in appropriate forms to the different classes of society. Like the sun and the moon in water, he is reflected in the affairs of the world, but without the slightest attachment on his part."
97: "By distributing emanation bodies in all the world systems of the universe, thus establishing the Dharma in the temporal world, the Buddha works without interruption for the welfare of living beings until the end of samsara.\nThe emanated forms of Buddhas and bodhisattvas are known in Tibetan as tulku (sprul-sku, in Sanskrit nirmana-kaya). When these are recognized among humanity, they are designated by the title rin-po-che, \"very precious one.\" Most important for us, on Jambu Island, is the form taken by the Buddha as the \"Sage of the Sakyas\" (Sakyamuni buddha), for he has established the Dharma and the Buddhist community on earth. One now performs the deeds of a Buddha, the great drama, as he showed them in middle India in the fifth century B.C.\nDescending into the world system, the Emanation body takes the form of a tenth-stage bodhisattva, the crown prince of Buddhahood, abiding in Tusita heaven. When the time has come for human birth, he presents his crown to Maitreya, to the next Buddha in turn, and enters his mother's womb on Jambu Island. He has been advised by a divinity that in India the elephant would be the most suitable form for this descent. His mother, a queen of the Sakya tribe, dreams of this event (that an elephant entered her side), and ten lunar months later, while she is holding the branch of a Sal tree in the garden of Lumbini, the bodhisattva emerges painlessly from her side. He has the form of a man, born into a noble family, for such is the highest status in this time and place. There is no martyrdom in the last life of a fully Awakened one; he is lord of the world, master of his fate, with infinite skill and patience in dealing with obstacles.\nThe local gods, vedic in this case, have the honors of washing away the afterbirth. Astrologers differ as to his destiny; he has the physical characteristics-such as the inscribed wheel-of a Wheel-turning King, but some say he will leave worldly life and turn to religion. His mother, believing this and wishing to avoid the sorrow of her son leaving home, dies seven days after his birth and ascends to the heaven of the Thirty-three.\nThe bodhisattva has a happy childhood and youth with some spontaneous experience of meditative trances, but for the most part he excels in worldly studies. He marries a worthy woman after winning a contest of martial arts to prove to her father that, although pacifistic by nature, he has the skills of his heritage. Surrounded in the palace by a circle of women and the pleasures of a crown prince of the world, he truly lives at the peak of human existence."
98: "At the age of twenty-nine, the bodhisattva shows himself disgusted with palace life and leaves home to seek liberation from samsara. The possibility of this departure has been announced by the seers, and his father, forewarned, has created obstacles to it, both physical and psychological. He permits his son no disagreeable experience, and blocks the palace gate at night with massive planks. But on some four occasions the young man, on taking the road toward his gardens, is confronted by visions sent by gods of the Pure Abodes. He sees an old man leaning painfully on a staff, a sick man, and a corpse being borne to cremation. Each time he is appalled to have his charioteer inform him that this is the general lot of human existence; each time he returns home to brood over the vision. On the fourth occasion he encounters a mendicant monk, calm and self-possessed, and is told of his disciplined life and his search for tranquility. The bodhisattva resolves to follow this example.\nThe king, when approached for permission, offers his son anything he might desire. The bodhisattva requests perpetual youth, health, and immortality - or, failing these, that he may not be reborn. Unable to make a satisfactory answer, the king. accedes to his request to leave home. Yet the king redoubles the guard and orders continuous entertainments for the prince. The songs and dancing make the young man feel like a caged bird. And when the women fall asleep, everyone in the palace having been lulled by the gods, he is shocked to see the ungraceful reality-\"disheveled and disarrayed, breathing heavily, yawning and sprawling\"-behind the sensual show. He looks in at his wife and son-born that very day - but is afraid to wake them to say good-bye. Indra, lord of the devas, opens the palace gate, and he rides forth on his horse in the company of the faithful charioteer. In the morning he sends them back, cuts off his long hair, and changes his silks for a hunter's russet robe."
99: "In various forest retreats the bodhisattva encounters the foremost religious teachers of his day. He finds yogis practicing strange forms of painful meditation. Enquiring as to their purpose, he is told that they seek the purification of karma and a happier rebirth. This seems senseless to him, for the aim is not liberation. To the greatest saints even the highest bliss of the gods is full of the misery of impermanence.\nHe studies with two Brahmanical masters who teach the liberation of the Supreme Self from the body. But the distinction between body and soul displeases him. A liberated soul is still an entity, and therefore subject to change and rebirth. The practices of these teachers leads to the formless states of trance, which he experiences and then rejects as. insufficient. Joined by five ascetics, he makes his way to the bank of the Nairanjana, near Gaya, to remove false views with truly intense ascetic practice.\nFor six years the bodhisattva abides in the \"space-pervading concentration,\" suspending his breath, slowing his vital functions, and feeding on a grain of rice or sesame each day. He sits immovably until the villagers think him dead. Finally, his mother, from the heaven of the Thirty-three, begs him not to die without fulfilling his destiny. Perceiving that asceticism is not the way to liberation, he enters the village nearby and begs a bowl of milk and rice from a young cowgirl. His five companions abandon him in disgust. He washes himself in the river and advances to the great Sal, the tree of Awakening, to sit in meditation."
100: "The bodhisattva overcomes the force and seductions of Mara, chief among all the gods of the Realm of Sense Desire. Approaching the Bodhi tree at dusk, the spirits of rain and wind freshen his path with dew and flowers. The mountains and trees bow in his direction; even newborn infants sleep with their faces pointed toward that tree, showing him the way. Taking his seat, the bodhisattva vows not to leave it until he has accomplished the great Awakening. The brahma gods, the devas, and many bodhisattvas approach to worship him.\nAt that time Mara comes to know that his authority is threatened, for here is one on the point of escaping the confines of his realm, and of showing the way to others. The word mara means \"deadener\"; he may be considered the personification of all sensory fears and distractions that obstruct success in meditation. Summoning his demonic hosts and mounting his great war chariot, Mara advances upon the tree, the center and navel of the earth. So terrible is his army that not one of the gods and devas dare to remain and face him.\nFirst Mara takes the guise of a messenger and deceitfully informs the bodhisattva that a tyrant has taken over his father's kingdom, cast the king in prison, and abused the women. None, he says, dare oppose him, but all pray for the prince's return. The bodhisattva reflects upon the malice, lust, and cowardice reflected in such deeds, and determines to transcend the mediocre state of the human heart.\nFailing in this device, Mara and his armies, in the forms of yaksas and kumbhandas, rush to the attack. They cast showers of missiles at him, rocks and deadly weapons, but these all turn to flowers as they enter his aura, falling at his feet or hanging in the air as a canopy over his head. Nor can whirlwinds and rainstorms move the bodhisattva, who is imperturbable.\nThen Mara challenges the bodhisattva to reveal what merits he has gained to make him worthy of liberation. The great meditator admits the great sacrifice that Mara must have made, in past lives, to attain his state of the lord god of the Realm of Desire. Yet he himself has made many such sacrifices during his career as bodhisattva to ordinary creatures as well as gods, and furthermore with liberation, not power, as his aim. Mara claims that the evidence for his own sacrifice is unimpeachable, for the bodhisattva himself has just been witness to it, but that for the bodhisattva's sacrifice there is no witness at all. Then the bodhisattva, touching the earth with his right hand, calls the earth goddess to witness. The earth shakes six times. Showing half her body and folding her hands with reverence, the goddess rises half out of the earth to attest to his fitness for enlightenment. Mara and his hosts flee like smaller animals before the lion's roar.\nMara, however, has one more device. He sends down his daughters, named Desire, Pleasure, and Passion, to tempt the bodhisattva. They dance before him like the swaying branches of a young and leafy tree. They appeal to him with spring songs. Yet he is not moved by the image of transient pleasures. As the sun sets, his victory is complete. The tree nymphs come to praise him, while many of Mara's following are ashamed and converted, making the creative effort for enlightenment."
101: "In the course of a night's meditations the bodhisattva attains the mystic illumination. Having subdued the various distractions presented by Mara, he ascends and descends, during the first watch of the night, through the four stages of trance. With his mind purified, calm, and freed from the workings of karma, he views with his wisdom eye all living beings. He sees them rising and falling on the wheel of life according to their karma. He sees the sufferings of the world.\nDuring the second watch of the night he sees all the past lives of him­ self and others: the experience of the whole world. In the third and final watch he seeks the cause and cure for this mass of suffering. The results of his investigations are formulated in the Four Noble Truths: The round of rebirth is basically suffering, its causes thirst and ignorance; nirvana would be its transcendence, and there is a means to attain it.\nJust before dawn he understands the nature and cause of suffering, this insight being codified in the twelvefold chain of dependent origination: Suffering and death arise dependent on birth, which arises dependent on reproduction, in tum dependent on grasping, desire, sensation, sensory contact, the six senses, the body-mind complex, consciousness, karmic impulses, and ignorance. He reviews them in reverse order: With the removal of ignorant activity, karma is not formed. Then consciousness will not arise, nor the body-mind complex, and on through rebirth and death.\nFor seven more weeks the Buddha subsists on the milkmaid's generous offering, she who is the first member of the Buddhist community. For the first week he sits contemplating the tree that was the site of his great attainment. In the second week he travels through three million world systems.  In the third he sits again by the tree, and in the fourth he walks to the eastern and western seas. Mara tempts him then to enter final nirvana, giving up his body and life. In the fifth week a naga king shields him from stormy weather, and in the sixth the Buddha goes to speak with some mendicants. At the end of the seventh week, sitting again by the tree, two merchants make him an offering of food; these are the first two Buddhist laymen. The Four Great Kings each offer a bowl to him with which to accept the food; he melts all four together so as not to disappoint any one of them. He sits again, intending to abide in silence and peace."
102: "Out of compassion for others, the Buddha leaves his forest abode in order to teach the doctrine. At first, seated under the Bodhi tree on his vajra seat, he shows himself reluctant to teach what most will not understand. Then he is prayed to by Great Brahma, lord of the gods of the Formless Realm, and by the chief of the thirty-three devas. He wonders whom to teach first. Knowing that his former teachers have recently passed away, he heads for Benares to meet his five former companions, although the tree nymphs warn him that Benares is sparsely populated and without shade. There he begs a meal and goes to the Deer Park northeast of town.\nWhen the five ascetics see him coming, they note his unmortified appearance and conspire to treat him with disrespect. But at his closer approach they are overcome by his splendor and spontaneously do him honor - preparing a seat and so forth. He explains to them that he has not attained mere longevity, but has become a Buddha, fully Awakened and omniscient. These five become the first monks.\nAt midnight the Buddha speaks with them to create a rapport. In the last watch of the night he turns the wheel of Dharma. The \"wheel\" represents authority: The wheel of Dharma moves swiftly, sweeping all before it, subduing obstacles to spiritual development and fixing what is subdued, taking one to the far reaches of the world. \"Turning the wheel\" means communicating the Dharma.\nIn the first turning of the great spiritual wheel, at the Deer Park near Benares, the Buddha teaches the middle way between the pursuit of pleasure and self-mortification-that is, the Noble Eightfold Path. Then three times he explains the Four Noble Truths. The five monks reach the Path of Vision-understanding the Four Noble Truths-and from there they are quickly Awakened.\nAmong the eight parts of the Noble Eightfold Path, right views, intentions, effort, and mindfulness are said to be the four spokes of the wheel of Dharma. Right speech, conduct, and livelihood are the hub, and right concentration the rim.\nIn this first turning of the wheel of Dharma, aimed at an audience well prepared in self-control and meditation, but strongly attached to wrong views of the self and the path, the elements of reality (Dharmas) are held to really exist. The \"self\" composed of dharmas is said to be a fiction. These are the sutras of the lesser vehicle. Twice more during his last life the Buddha turns the wheel. The intermediate turning, at Vulture's Peak near the present Rajgir, teaches to advanced arhats and bodhisattvas the nonexistence of dharmas and the doctrine of their essential emptiness ­ that is, the Madhyamika sutras of the Greater Vehicle. The last turning of the wheel occurs at Mount Malaya in the south and other places; it is the Yogacara or mind-only doctrine and ascertains the nature of the absolute principle of emptiness. The sutras of the last turning show the elements of reality to be (1) imagined and nonexistent, (2) interdependent and \"real\" in a conventional sense, and (3) absolutely real in their nature of emptiness.\nThe tantras are included within the two later turnings of the wheel. They constitute practices revealed at various places but kept secret until much later.\nIn reality the Buddha never speaks a word from the time he becomes enlightened, for he has no discursive thought. Nonetheless, just as a hanging cymbal may be made to sound by the wind, without any gong to beat it, so his voice arises in response to the needs and dispositions of the various living beings who are his audience. From the Awakening of the Buddha streams the whole corpus of Buddhist doctrine, developed and elaborated over the course of centuries, which enables those who read it to eradicate false views and to attain Buddhahood."
103: "To impress those for whom verbal teachings are insufficient, the Buddha performs miracles. Leaving the Deer Park, he returns to Magadha. In Sravasti he stays in a community of long-haired ascetics who are worshipers of fire. On the first evening the leader Kasyapa warns him of a ferocious fire-breathing naga in the hut that only he can handle. The Buddha enters the hut, and in the course of the night fights fire with fire, exhausting the wrath of the serpent as the ascetics, watching the smoke from outside, give him up as lost.\nThen again during the winter the Buddha magically creates some five hundred charcoal burners for his hosts during a cold spell. On another occasion some baneful influence prevents them from cutting wood and lighting the fires for sacrifice, and the Buddha helps them with his magic. In the hot season a freak rainstorm causes a terrible flood around the hermitage. Kasyapa, searching for his honored guest in a boat, finds that he has created dry land in the river.\nIn all, some thirty-five hundred miracles are required to convert this school of Brahmanical ascetics, who are not easily impressed. On several occasions the Buddha visits far-off points of the Meru world system, bringing back exotic foods: milk from the Western Continent, self-germinated rice from Kuru, the Jambu fruit from Mount Meru.\nAfter converting the ascetics at last, the Buddha disappears for three weeks, vacationing in the heaven of the Thirty-three gods, where he instructs his mother in the Dharma. He descends again on a staircase of lapis lazuli built by the architect of the gods. One nun of his order, it is said, did him honor on his return by taking on the appearance of a Wheel-turning King."
104: "In its final act, the Emanation body demonstrates the passing into nirvana. Mara visits the Buddha and argues that since the Buddha has completed his mission of establishing the doctrine and the community for this age, he should enter nirvana. Because the Buddha's close disciples fail to ask him to remain, he accedes to Mara's request. He cuts off the karmic forces supporting his life and lives for a final three months by psychic powers alone. Then on the road to Kushinagara, the site of his demise, he is entertained by a metalworker named Cunda, who serves a succulent dish of pork. The Buddha refuses to allow his companions to partake of it and has it interred after he has eaten. Later he falls ill with dysentery.\nOn the day of the parinirvana the Buddha washes in the river, and those about him marvel at his physical glow. The year is 486 B.C.; he is eighty years of age. Toward evening he lies down on his right side between two Sal trees, hands under his head: the \"lion's position.\" His last two personal disciples are encountered. The first, a musician, is converted by an appearance of the Buddha at his door, the phantom body playing a lute. The other, a Brahmanical ascetic, enters his dying presence and is persuaded to embark on the Noble Eightfold Path.\nTo his close disciples, too shy now to ask questions, the Buddha gives his last instructions on the doctrine and the community. He counsels them to accept only teachings that are authenticated by comparison with the Buddha's discourses, the monastic discipline, and the true nature of things. He gives instructions for the interment of his cremated remains, \"like those of a Wheel-turning King,\" in a stupa built at a crossroads. Finally, regarding his passing, he makes his famous last statement: \"Karmic composites are subject to the law of dissolution, coming and going they are impermanent; indeed, all phenomena that are born of causes and conditions are impermanent. Do not lament, but attain your goal without negligence, because by vigilance we come to full Awakening and the other fruits of the path.\"\nThe Buddha rises through the four stages of trance and the Realm of Form, and through the four equalizations of the Formless Realm. He attains the Peak of Existence, the equanimity of cessation. He descends through the eight stages and rises again through the four trances. From the top, a karmically neutral (avyakrta) place, he enters nirvana. The earth shakes, stars fall, and rainbows and music fill all the quarters of space."
