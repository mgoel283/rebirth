1: "Crossed double vajras bar your exit from this very special hell. This is the destination of those who abuse the tantric path, who break their tantric vows through distraction or selfishness. Here the fierce dharma protectors turn upon one in wrath. This is a hell of the most frightful demonic images, the most fearful hell, for its suffering is paranoia rather than physical pain -- difficult for anyone else to assuage. Fear for oneself makes it almost impossible to see through the images and escape."
2: "Falling upside down for two thousand years, one reaches the deepest and hottest of the hells. The others seem idyllic by comparison, for the sufferings here follow one another without intermission.\n\n The Avici Hell is a prison of incandescent iron. Flames beat against the sides. The gates open and close to frustrate the inhabitants. Some are boiled in iron kettles of molten bronze, \"head down like the ingredients of rice soup.\"\n\n This inverted place of torture represents the complete pollution of the world by malicious confusion and perverse, ego centered drive. Such a  state is created by activities that undermine the basis of civilized life: the murder of one's parents, teacher, or holy personage; cutting off the water supply of a nation; and, especially, destruction of the Dharma or the Buddhist community, for this is a blow to the chances of others for spiritual advancement-the worst of crimes, and the very opposite of a bodhisattva's conduct."
3: "In these adjoining torture chambers, one suffers the tortures of intense heat. The ordinary Hot Hell is the karmic creation of those who have committed crimes involving fire, such as incendiary action or killing living creatures in a forest fire. Molten bronze is poured through one's mouth, burning away the intestines. One's anus is pierced through to the crown of the head with thorny, one-spiked weapons.\n\n The very Hot Hell is a result of the general activities of the milder he1Js-ki11ing, stealing, sexual abuse, and lying-associated with the intentional perversion of truth. Quack doctors, for example, are found here. However, this is the special destiny of offenders against spiritual practice: stealing food from yogis, raping nuns or virtuous laywomen, seducing monks, or persuading people to disbelieve in karma with any sort of perverse doctrine. This would include the professional tempting of people into harmful or unprofitable paths. In the main hall of this hell, fierce demons with huge black bellies, flaming eyes, and hooked fangs drag the offender into lakes of fire studded with iron spikes."
4: "The sins of these two hells both involve misuse of the mouth: the improper use of intoxicants and lying. In consequence, demons fill one's mouth with molten copper, which destroys one's insides.\nDrunkenness is not of itself a misdeed, but by becoming so intoxicated with alcohol that one breaks another of the vows - by killing, stealing, or abusing sexuality - one falls laughing, it is said, into the Howling Hell. Especially, the sale of liquor for profit or its use for the harmful manipulation of others gives rise to this bad karma.\nThe Great Howling Hell arises from lying or harsh speech with spiteful intention: perjury, bribery, betrayal of trust, false advertising, and venal government or justice. One who has lied while quarreling with a companion has his tongue grow to great length. Demons then dig in it a deep ditch, which is filled with molten copper; worms are born in its sides, which devour the tongue."
5: "These two hot hells are created by those who violate the second and third guides to lay conduct: stealing and improper sexuality. The offense must have been compounded with murder, for all the hellish states have malice as their cause, whether against life or the killing of spiritual possibilities.\n\n The Black Rope Hell is for thieves-those who have taken what is not offered, or appropriated more than their fair share at the expense of others. The victim is caught by demons and bound to the ground with charcoal blackened cords. His body is sliced along the markings with fiery saws and axes until it is shredded to bits.\n\n The \"Crushing\" or \"Crowded\" Hell is for malicious sexual offenders. Their torture is to be crushed between iron mountains until they revive; then they are crushed again. In one area of this hell one wanders through forests of trees with sharp leaves. At the top of a tree one spies a beautiful and alluring lover from the past. Climbing the tree, the hot leaves destroy one's body, and on reaching the top the phantom lover is heard calling from the ground. At this point the leaves of the tree reverse themselves to point upward. After a painful descent, the image is once again seen above. Blinded by desire born from ignorance, these victims of delusion never cease pursuing and being torn."
6: "One has fallen into the first of eight hot hells, this one reserved for killers. For the intentional murder of living beings -- as through warfare­ whether directly or by removing the requisites for life, one suffers here by being tied to others. A string of people murder one another, then are revived by a cool wind to kill and be killed again until their karma is exhausted.\n\n One of the neighborhoods of this hell contains hunters who remorselessly have killed birds or deer for food. Here, in the \"place of excrement,\" they are forced to eat a kind of dung fi1led with worms whose beaks are diamond hard; they are then themselves devoured from inside.
7: One suffers now in the Cold Hells beneath the earth, parallel to the infernos. As with all hellish states, this is the result of hateful activity - in particular, of crimes against the Dharma from within. There are eight cold hells, their names being sufficient indication of their nature.	\n\n\t arbuda-blistering;\n\t nirarbuda-broken blisters;\n\t atata--chattering teeth;\n\t hahava-where the mouth is frozen and one can only groan;\n\t huhuva-where no articulate sound at all is possible;\n\t utpala-like the blue lotus, where one has a greenish-blue color and one's flesh splits in six petals;\n\t padma-like the red ten-petaled lotus;\n\t mahapadma or pundarika-like the thousand-petaled lotus."
8: "This is hell on earth-isolated places such as a river, mountain, or desert. Whereas the lower hells have been created by the collective karma of all living beings, these are innumerable and individualized, created by individual or group activities."
9: "With great power and cruelty one has become Yama (or his sister Yami), lord and judge of the dead, or one of his police demons (yamaraksasa). His court is the gateway to hell. Ordinary persons must confront him when they die, gazing into his mirror of karma. Yama has the face of a buffalo, and a buffalo is his mount. His right hand holds a club known as \"the punisher,\" the top of which is a skull. His left hand makes a threatening gesture with a noose. He blazes like the fire that consumes the world at the end of the age.\n\n Yama's world is beneath the earth where the sun never shines, beneath blackish red and green clouds; a dark iron castle without doors surrounded by lakes of gore from which fierce spirits, blazing with hatred, are spontaneously produced.\n\n Beneath Yama himself a monkey-headed demon holds a set of sca1es on which white and black pebbles, representing one's good and bad deeds, determine one's destiny. After judgment, fierce police demons seize the defendant and lead him upward or downward to his next rebirth.\n\n The ugly demons of Yama's retinue, male and female, have come into this state through avarice and jealousy. They may have been wicked kings - or government agents in their previous lives, it is not the case, however, that the torturers of hell, under his command, are living creatures themselves, for if they were living beings, they would also experience the sufferings-the extreme heat, and so forth-of the hells.  Rather, they are a part the karmic delusion of the poor hell-beings.\n\n Yama himself has a subjective aspect, being the personification of the inevitable judgment of an individual's deeds, and a concealed, or inner, aspect in that he is inherent in consciousness that is defiled by desire, hatred, and ignorance. In this square he is called \"karmic Yama\" to show that the external Lord of the Dead is intended."
10: "Just under the earth-and roving upon it-are these creatures, tormented by greed. Their senses are distorted, and the earth seems without sustenance. They have mouths like pins, bellies like mountains, and throats that tum food to fire. Rivers of water take on the appearance of pus or blood. Rushing to a phantasmagoric banquet, they are beaten away by fierce warriors. Fruit trees seem to turn them away with thorny branches. Others among them, who have stolen out of greed or regretted making offerings, are forced to live on vomit or excrement.\n\n Pretas can only be nourished by faith-that is, by offerings made in the course of a religious ceremony and then consigned to them."
11: "Residing mostly in the great oceans, animals are created as a result of previous stupidity-intentional ignorance. Guided by their instinctual reactions, they have, for the most part, no intelligence or will. If domestic, they are bound to servitude; if wild, they are doomed to be killed for the sake of their bodies. Generally, they must suffer to eat whatever comes near their mouths.\n\n The serpent is said to be born from anger, the lion from pride, the dog from arrogance, the monkey from greed, the crow from insolence, venomous types from having been animal killers, the carnivore from greed and anger, and the horse from unpaid debts."
12: "One is born a mythological beast endowed with supernatural powers. These animals are \"divine\" because their birth is miraculous, like that of a god, and not from a womb or an egg. Some are pets of the gods-the swans, peacocks, bees, and stags populating the gardens of the heavens. These live in a state of radiance, enjoying the pleasures of the heavens but without any sharp intelligence, and are said to be former sculptors and painters who donated their services to the community. Others are mounts of the gods, such as the nagas and garudas - huge birds with the trunk of a human being and the deadly enemies of the naga-serpents. Gandharvas, \"fragrance eaters,\" are celestial musicians, born for their great love of flowers. Still others are demigods under the command of the gods. The demigods reside in mountains or trees and become the object of local cults, very powerful in comparison to ordinary creatures but often monstrous and malformed-the karmic result of liberality mixed with a violent nature. These yaksas and kumbhandas can bestow good or ill on humanity depending on their disposition."
13: "These water serpents are human from the waist up, rather like mer creatures. They are spirits of the underworld, to be found at points where their realm impinges on ours-such as springs and rivers. They store great treasures of wealth and precious stones, and sometimes books of secret teachings in underwater palaces. Like other wealthy beings, however, they are dangerous and volatile. Benign nagas can be the most generous of allies, but their fierce counterparts are known to cause certain classes of disease. In Tibet they are propitiated as lords of the rain.\n\n The powerful nagas were formerly people very generous in temperament, but also angry and cruel. Their deadly enemy is the garuda, strongest of the birds."
14: "These ferocious man-eating demons (raksasas) frequent the night­haunting cemeteries, attacking people, and devouring children.  Their figures are blood-red; they ride a red ass with a white belly called a bong-bu, swift as the wind. With supernormal powers they can take any shape. Demon Island is identified as Sri Lanka, southeast of India. These demons plagued Tibet in ancient times until they were bound by Padmasambhava to the Dharma. Their karmic inheritance derives from the pitiless murder of animals for the benefit of others. From killing they become monstrous and malformed; from giving to others they grow powerful."
15: "One is born among the \"antigods,\" so known for their intense jealousy of the gods of thirty-three who got them drunk and cast them out of heaven. The asuras are proud, envious, angry, and warlike. They envy the gods their riches, especially the fruits of the wish-granting tree whose roots are in their realm but that flowers high up in the deva realms on Mount Meru. Unable to defeat the gods in battle, they attempt to cut down the tree.\n\n The asuras live in a \"city of light.\" One asura king named Rahu is responsible for eclipses, periodically swallowing the sun or the moon. They are also associated with storms, earthquakes, comets, meteors, and other astral phenomena."
16: "This is the criminal yogi, who accomplishes the worldly occult powers (siddhi)-pacifying, prospering, subjugating, and destroying -- from a desire for power. The state of this demigod Rudra, whose name means \"the howler\" in Sanskrit, results from practicing the tantras without a firm commitment to the welfare of others.\n\n \"Rudra\" is a name for the god Shiva, and the story of Evil Freedom is the explanation of how this god-as-bully came to exist. There was once a bodhisattva tantrist known as Prince Unassailable. Two men, the first named \"Kau Ensnared,\" whose dharma name became Black Freedom (Moksakala), and his servant Brahmadeva, applied to him for instruction. The servant understood well the import of the secret teachings and kept his vows; but the other took the tantras as an excuse for self-indulgence, broke his vows with all sorts of hideous activities, and expelled the other. When he died, he was hurled into lower states of rebirth for many ages, finally appearing as the fierce non-Buddhist god Rudra His mother died at birth and the townspeople, frightened at his appearance, buried him with her. Feeding on her flesh, he emerged to lead an army of demons in conquest of the world. His former teacher and fellow student, having meanwhile attained great powers within the Dharma, took the forms of a horse (the fierce Hayagriva) and a boar (the diamond sow) and subjugated him.\n\n A parallel story shows Shiva, \"lord of the world,\" being bound by the fierce bodhisattva Vajrapani to become Mahakala, a Dharma protector.\n\n Rudra is the god of the type of yogi whose accomplishments are based on ego gratification(atma-vada), His \"liberation\" is a form of claustrophobia-imprisonment in the self-made coffin of his ego. He fancies himself the creator and lord of the universe, and is the prototype of the jealous god who must attempt to control everything around him. Hence Shiva's religion is that of power and fear, known in India as linga worship. Stories of his destructive pride are numerous. The god of love, in Indian mythology, has no body because Rudra burned it with a glance from his third eye, in vengeance for disturbing his meditations. An asura king who made offerings to him reluctantly, placing him among the last rank of the gods, had all his temple and offering destroyed by fire and was only able to placate the god by giving up his daughter Parvati.\n\n Rudra is placed here in the last rank of the gods, and just above the less powerful asuras. His only escape from himself is conversion by a tantric bodhisattva."
